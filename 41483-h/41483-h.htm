<h2>The Yazoo Mystery<br />
<br />

CHAPTER I</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> harbor-master entered briskly but dubiously
the room of the ship's first officer.</p>

<p>"What about the five men for the <em>Domus</em>?" he
bellowed.</p>

<p>"All ready to sign, sir," assured the manager of
the employment agency, pointing toward two saddle
colored negroes, a Spaniard, and a limp figure half
asleep, slouching in the corner on a narrow bench,
one hand clutching an expensive leather bag.</p>

<p>"It is the best I could do on such short notice,"
assured the agency man in an undertone, noticing
that the first officer's inventory was not very encouraging.</p>

<p>"Get them up here to sign. We're anchored in
the stream, losing two thousand dollars every hour
we stay here. We need five more firemen&mdash;anything
that looks human," he added impatiently, spreading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>the ship's articles on the counter that reached across
the smelly water-front den.</p>

<p>"Come on and sign up, boys," said the agency
man with assumed good nature.</p>

<p>While the two negroes and the Spaniard were
signing, the ship's first officer went to the sleeping
figure in the corner, took up his free hand and felt
of the palm, then dropped it disgustedly as he took
the man by the shoulders and shook him vigorously.</p>

<p>"Come on and sign up, Strong," he shouted into
his ear.</p>

<p>Strong labored with himself, still holding to his
bag, half staggered to the counter and signed on the
line indicated&mdash;"Hiram Strong, Jr."</p>

<p>The signature was plain and businesslike. Evidently
the Candidate had known better days.</p>

<p>"He's been kicked out or disowned," muttered the
first officer to me while he was signing up. "He
won't be worth a cuss. Look&mdash;those hands never
did a lick of work&mdash;but he will fill the list," he
added, walking about nervously and sizing me up
with apparent approbation.</p>

<p>The agency man came up at once and held the
pen towards me, and without hesitation I signed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>"Ben Taylor" on the line beneath. While I was
thus engaged Hiram leaned against the counter
weak and listless, his bag between his feet. We had
both signed as firemen or stokers on the steamship
<em>Domus</em> for a round trip to an unnamed Gulf,
or Mexican port.</p>

<p>Although pretty well awake by this time Strong
did not resent my taking his arm and helping him
a bit. He made no comment at first, but after he
got used to the lively walk along the dock, he began
to show signs of saying something.</p>

<p>"Old pal," he began, without turning his head,
"I&mdash;I've got a headache&mdash;top's coming off&mdash;and my
stomach is all jelly. It shakes as I walk and makes
me sick," he ended under his breath.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right after you get some sleep."</p>

<p>"Y-e-s&mdash;I think&mdash;I h-h-ope so&mdash;&mdash;I've had an
awful time&mdash;an awful time, pardee&mdash;but this is my
last&mdash;this is my last," he added, more to himself.</p>

<p>His bloodless face and lips, pink lids and bloodshot
eyes indicated a disordered system urgently rebelling
against recent abuses.</p>

<p>After we got aboard the harbor-master's tug, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>very weak, he refused to sit down. Noting
that I had found a seat, he lurched over to me.</p>

<p>"Old pal, everything looks yellow to me, even the
sun looks yellow&mdash;sort of faded. Does it look yellow
to you?" he asked, blinking at the clear setting
sun, and although his power to realize was at low
ebb, he picked me out evidently as being different
from the others. By that act he exercised a discrimination
that predestined an exciting and almost
unbelievable career.</p>

<p>"The sun looks all right to me," I told him, smiling
up in sympathy.</p>

<p>"I guess it's me&mdash;it's terrible&mdash;but this is the last&mdash;I'm
going to work now. Little Hiram is going
to work for the balance of his life&mdash;I got to, that's
all," he ended, with a dogged determination that I
hoped would survive after he recovered from his
unsettled and polluted condition. I steadied him a
little when climbing the ladder from the tug to the
ship, which attention he seemed to appreciate.</p>

<p>"Old pal, I must go to bed. If I don't I will die,"
said he as we went forward to the firemen's
sleeping quarters. There he tumbled into a lower
bunk, not stopping to remove even the cheap cap he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>wore. In an incredibly short time he was "dead to
the world" and snoring at a lively clip.</p>

<p>Upon returning to the deck I heard a loud grunt
from the Siren and at once the ship began to swing
out into the stream, heading toward the Statue
of Liberty and that great sea beyond the Narrows.</p>

<p>The captain still leaned over the bridge, taking
stock of his nondescript crew of firemen that loitered
about, forward. His bulk evidenced a growing appetite
and his almond shaped eyes suggested the prenatal
influence of a Chinaman. It was hard to
understand how so much tallow and bone, in a
florid lumpy skin, ever became master of a big ship.
Such luggage as Hiram Strong, Jr. and I had
brought aboard might have told him a story, but
he didn't care; all he wanted was thirty-five human
machines, capable of shoveling coal&mdash;in four-hour
shifts&mdash;in a temperature of a hundred and twenty-five
degrees. He knew that his ship was marked
as a "hell," and that no fireman would ship for a
second trip.</p>

<p>While standing beside the rail and studying the
retreating outlines of Battery Park and its wonderful
skyline, I was approached by the firemen's mess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>steward, who wore a dirty white jacket and apron.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose that young feller will want anything
to eat?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I guess sleep is better now," I replied, interpreting
in his round greasy face evident good-will.</p>

<p>"The firemen are eating and you had better go
in," he said, but seemingly in no hurry for me to
tear myself away. The tip seemed a good one, so I
made an opening for a better acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Where are we bound, steward?"</p>

<p>"We're bound out and back to this port, but at
how many places we will call, God knows. I don't!
When we start, lately, we never know when we'll
get back. Sometimes we call at Key West, and
usually at Galveston or New Orleans. Don't you
know what you signed for?" he asked, without surprise,
but grinning significantly.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, hesitating somewhat. I wondered
why he continued to grin. Then he again
asked:</p>

<p>"Are you coming down to mess yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come right down."</p>

<p>Following him below, I crowded over on one of
the nondescript crew to a seat on the end of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>bench at a narrow, bare table, and received from the
steward a half-gallon of thick soup dished up in an
enameled pan from a galvanized-iron wash-tub.
Later I was supplied from the same laundry utensil
a liberal portion of what was intended for a meat
stew, and a war allowance of bread. I was wondering
how Hiram Strong, Jr., accustomed to uptown
dining, would relish this atmosphere with its
filthy service and coarse food. The men along the
bench beside me consumed the soup noisily, like
Bowery bums, and bit from chunks of meat on the
ends of their forks like swine with their forefeet in
a trough.</p>

<p>Sitting at one end, I was able to size up my fellow-firemen,
twenty-five of whom were devouring
food with great relish as they chattered like magpies,
mostly in a foreign tongue. Negroes of all
shades, Mexicans, Poles, Italians, Greeks, all sweated
out, thin and bleached to the shade of a cadaver.
I speculated again as to how young Strong would
mix with this motley crew, and why he had allowed
himself to choose stoking as a means of livelihood.</p>

<p>After eating I went below, but Strong had not
moved and it seemed that his thin white hands and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>expensive footwear were more out of place than
ever. I wondered if he had any money left.
Usually were to be found some light-fingered gentry
among tramp-steamer firemen, so I took a small
chain and padlock from my bag and chained his
grip with mine to a bunk stanchion.</p>

<p>Returning to the deck, it was something of a
shock to note the ship in complete darkness, no
light visible save the red and green signals on either
side. Later I learned that the globes were removed
from the passenger cabins to prevent even a flash
from the rooms of any one disinclined to obey
"Lights out" at seven p. m. by order of the Naval
authorities.</p>

<p>After clearing Sandy Hook and rounding Scotland
lightship, by locating the North Star I saw
that the skipper was heading a little east of south
against a sharp, cold wind, close in to the Jersey
coast, where lights were plainly visible. I was
rather astonished to see all lifeboats lowered from
their davits to the level of the steerage deck, and by
edging down that way, saw they were provisioned
with water, biscuits, lanterns and all necessary
equipment for immediate use. Then I realized that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>young Strong had not only chosen an unusual occupation
but a rather unpropitious time in which to
sign up for duty on the high seas.</p>

<p>But with visions of four o'clock in the morning,
the hour assigned us to begin our work, I returned
to the bunkroom to go to bed.</p>

<p>Hiram Strong had moved neither hand nor foot,
but his breathing was more normal. A dark blue
light was the only illumination in the place, giving
to everything a mere shadowy appearance. I was
glad to notice that the place was well ventilated,
fairly clean, and likely to be free from vermin.</p>

<p>At three-thirty in the morning a heavy hand was
laid on us, and we were told to roll out to go on
watch. To my surprise, young Strong responded at
once, with much yawning and stretching. Now and
then he would sigh deeply, ending in a sort of dismal
moan, hard to tell whether from resignation or
abandon. He spoke for the first time after I had
tumbled out and had begun pulling on my shoes.
He seemed to recognize me in the uncertain light.</p>

<p>"Do we get anything to eat before we go to
work?" he asked, leaning against his bunk dressed
in the correct street attire in which he had slept.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I think by going aft to the ship's kitchen
we can get something; coffee, anyhow," I replied,
stripping down to my underwear.</p>

<p>"Is that the way you go to work?" he asked,
quickly noticing my matter-of-fact preparations.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?" he asked, surprised.</p>

<p>"Well, it's pretty hot down there; and besides,
it's very dirty," I replied, pleasantly but convincingly.
"Shoes, pants and undershirt are about all you
can stand," I added.</p>

<p>I had to wait a while for him to remove all but
those needful garments before starting for the
kitchen, there to find good hot coffee and a dish of
that same thick soup.</p>

<p>He followed my lead again, silently, deliberately
drinking two cups of coffee and eating the soup.
Then it was time for us to go.</p>

<p>He negotiated the several narrow iron stairs leading
down to the boiler-room like a cat avoiding
water, and looked ruefully at his hands blackened
by contact with the greasy handrail. A pink silk
undershirt and polished shoes contrasted strangely
with the coarse, black pull-on's and dingy brogans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>of those at work. He must have noticed the contrast.
Stripped, he showed a compact figure, with good
lung capacity and likely a good heart, that being
an absolute necessity in order to tolerate the extreme
heat of a boiler-room.</p>

<p>The engineer on watch asked me if I had ever
fired, as though expecting an affirmative.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied.</p>

<p>"But this young fellow is a 'greeny'?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so."</p>

<p>"You and him take the two end boilers on the
left&mdash;they are as cool as any&mdash;and give him a few
tips, will you, till he gets his hand in? Two hundred
and eighty pounds on the gauge," he added,
as a hint to keep the dial at that notch. He then
told Strong I would show him what to do.</p>

<p>As we moved down over the piles of coal between
a battery of boilers facing the rather narrow corridor
between them, Strong remarked to me, "I'll
do the best I can, sir!"</p>

<p>It did not seem so very hot when we first went
in, but I noticed there was only one ventilator, which
came down about midway.</p>

<p>Strong followed me over to the end and watched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>me with interest when I took the twelve-foot poker&mdash;a
one-inch steel bar with a big eye bent on one
end and spatula shaped at the other&mdash;for the purpose
of freeing the clinkers from the grates before
shaking them down into the ash pan.</p>

<p>"I will clean your fire for you this time and you
can see how it's done," I suggested, and proceeded
to do so. "You know, the first thing you do when
going on watch is to clean the fire, but it must be
done quickly to keep the steam from going down
too much." He listened attentively and good-naturedly,
but still silent, as one about to be initiated
into a college fraternity and was waiting for
something to happen.</p>

<p>I handed him a scoop and told him to put in a
half dozen scoop-loads at a time and to be sure
and get it well back on the grates. I then proceeded
to clean my own grate.</p>

<p>Taking up the scoop, he filled it brimful, and
started for the furnace door like a girl shoveling
snow. He missed the narrow opening and the coal
fell off into the ashes. He did not swear as I had
expected but glanced sheepishly at me, then about
him, to see if others noticed it, but we were all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>too busy with our own back-breaking jobs to pay
heed to his worries.</p>

<p>Determined to be successful, he walked close to
the furnace door, exposing his face and hands to
the glaring fire, and succeeded in getting the next
shovelful pretty well back on the grates. After repeating
this a half dozen times his face took on a
"Turkey red" and he puffed like a lizard.</p>

<p>After a few more trials and a little more instruction
the novelty of doing it well seemed to interest
him, and two hours wore away. He soon learned
to watch the steam gauge above him and kept it
pointing at the requisite two hundred and eighty.</p>

<p>At the end of the shift he leaned heavily against
the bulkhead next to his furnace, panting like a race-horse.
The perspiration rolled off of him until
even his well-tailored trousers were wet and his
pink silk undershirt a sight to behold. His face was
the shade of pickled beets mixed with coal dust,
and his hands the color of the lobsters he was accustomed
to eat after midnight, his palms blistered
and sore, from the friction of the shovel handle.</p>

<p>His neat black shoes, now grimy and rough, were
full of water and pinched his feet. I did not give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>him the extra pair of soft cotton flannel gloves
I had brought along for him until he asked me
where I had got mine. Then I showed him how
to cool off by standing under the ventilator, for
which he seemed very grateful. He looked curiously
at me, evidently discovering that he and I
were the only ones down in the furnace room not
of a hardened class. He seemed inclined to stay
under the refreshing ventilator, and I noted the
hands of his steam gauge drop back to two hundred
and seventy, so I opened the door, cleaned
the grates and spread over a fresh bed of coal.</p>

<p>He came over while I was doing this, and I gave
him some little tricks on how to spread the fuel and
not expose his hands and face to the heat.</p>

<p>He seemed to appreciate this and surprised me
by his cleverness in making use of my tips. For a
time he revived and I thought he was going to pull
through his first watch all right, but at the end of
another hour he became shaky on his legs, and his
arms scarcely supported the empty shovel. The intense
heat and effort had a telling effect on him and
it did not surprise me when he toppled over on
the coal pile in a dead faint.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Hiram Strong collapsed it did not surprise
the other firemen. It was not a rare occurrence for
even seasoned firemen to faint. But it did amaze
the engine-room crew at the ease with which I took
him in my arms, for he weighed at least one hundred
and sixty pounds. I laid him down beneath
the ventilator, where the others had prepared a
place for him. I then removed his cap and dashed
a pail of cold water over his face and chest, coal
dust and dirt having washed up in his black, wavy
hair.</p>

<p>For the first time since I had met him I got a
good look at the youngster's face. Even during this
temporary lapse the slightly upturned corners of his
mouth and the red of his lips showed, lending the
impression that he was about to break out into a
sunny smile. There was nothing about his features
to indicate the confirmed inebriate or debauchee.
He had a good, honest ear, a clean neck and a generous
breadth of shoulder. After making sure of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>his respiration and heart action, I returned to my
post to feed his furnace and mine. To maintain two
hundred and eighty pounds of steam on the gauge
required constant, back-breaking shoveling. In a
few minutes both furnaces were roaring, with one
blowing off a notice to the engineer that, although
one of the crew had fainted, the boilers were hot.</p>

<p>It was perhaps a quarter of an hour before
Strong raised himself to a sitting posture and
looked over toward me. He was dazed, and blinked
like an owl. I waved to him to stay where he was
and rest. For answer he made a "cat's cradle" by
clasping his hands before his knees, unmindful of
the fact that he was seated in a pool of water and
saturated coal dust.</p>

<p>We evidently had a good head wind outside, for
it rushed down through the big ventilator as though
driven by an exhaust fan, thus rapidly reviving
Strong. However, it would not be well for him
to remain in the draft too long, so I crossed over
and helped him to regain his feet. He reeled and
stumbled as he walked back to his station, which
took grit, but there was no evidence of self-pity.</p>

<p>For the remainder of the watch Strong was unable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>to do much work. First he tried to shovel coal,
but found he couldn't lift it. However, he insisted
on staying around while I shoveled, occasionally
opening and closing the furnace doors. All the
while he maintained his attitude of silence, apparently
taking it for granted that I understood the situation
and was willing to help him. At last the eight
o'clock relief crew came, and although still weak, he
made the narrow iron stair to the deck much easier
than when he descended four hours before. He
was adapting himself to the conditions the best he
could.</p>

<p>Strong soon washed up and donned clean wear,
which seemed to refresh him, but coal dust still
showing about his eyes, ears and brow gave him
the appearance of an actor made up for his part.
At mess he devoured soup with relish, but when he
tried the stew, made up of overdone neck, cuts of
fried beef and cold potatoes, he tossed the pan and
its contents overboard.</p>

<p>"I need sleep more than that stuff," he said, and
straightway made for his bunk.</p>

<p>Six hours later I found him standing beside me
at the rail in the waist of the ship and he appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>to be much improved. His fine skin glowed, but
his hands looked as though they had been parboiled,
with palms badly blistered. His trousers were dirty,
dry, stiff, baggy and wrinkled. On the upper part
of his body he wore nothing but a silk undershirt,
and for his overworked feet he had pulled on a
pair of sandals.</p>

<p>It is quite as impossible to disguise a real man
as it is for a make-believe to pass himself off for a
gentleman. Though unaware of how to go about
it, he began taking my measure quite as coldly as I
was his, after which he spoke his first connected
words since we came together.</p>

<p>"It was mighty decent of you to help me out last
night," he said, affably, holding a lighted cigarette
contemplatively. Evidently his decision favored
me.</p>

<p>"Every one has to make a beginning; you did
very well to stay there during the whole of your
first watch," said I, ignoring his thanks.</p>

<p>"Is it always as hot down there as it was last
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes; sometimes more so. You see, last night
we had a head wind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"After my hands harden, and my stomach becomes
accustomed to the food, I guess I'll be able
to stand it all right." As he said this he looked at
the palms of his hands ruefully. The backs were
scarlet and glossy.</p>

<p>"You can if you want to," I replied. "You have
the build. The food is coarse, but perhaps the best
for that kind of work. Four hours is not very long
to stand anything; you have not worked lately?"</p>

<p>"Lately?&mdash;never!" Then as though frightened
at my reference to his past or even himself, he surprised
me by asking, "How soon do we eat again?&mdash;I
believe I could eat some of that horse-meat now."</p>

<p>"You think it's horse-meat?"</p>

<p>"Well, if it's not horse-meat, it came off a bull
just behind the horns. However, my grates are
clean and there's a good draft; I believe I can get
up steam on it now," he ended with a reckless
laugh, indicating that, although languid from his
final fling in New York, he had noted fully how to
proceed with his work in the boiler-room.</p>

<p>"Perhaps by going back to the galley we can
get a bite. It's nearly two hours before we go on
watch, but it's better to give the stomach a chance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>before doing hard work," I suggested, leading the
way to that mysterious quarter of the ship where
the cook is king.</p>

<p>This time we inherited mutton stew and the
usual bread allowance, which we ate as we sat on
the edge of a hatch.</p>

<p>Looking across the water, I noted that we were
still hugging shore, but were now far enough south
to be free from the chill November winds of New
York. We were now favored with a balmy, invigorating
breeze.</p>

<p>Strong's first question was not unexpected after
he glanced at some curious passengers on the deck
above us, amused at our sumptuous meal and manner
of taking it.</p>

<p>"How do you happen among this gang?" he
asked, laying his bread allowance on the hatch and
poising a knife and fork that came with the ship
direct from the builders twenty years before.</p>

<p>I looked at him squarely and knew I had to give
a logical reply. His straight nose showed the power
of logical analysis. The thought came to me that
he had somehow robbed a marble image of Cleopatra
of its nose and clapped it on his own face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>There could be no question of his inherent refinement.
Such a person one usually answers civilly,
though the questions be frivolous.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, in order to get a marine license
you must do a certain amount of sea duty in the
fire room."</p>

<p>"Is a marine license so very desirable?"</p>

<p>"Chief engineer is a pretty good berth, especially
now. Those running in the war zone get good pay
and a big bonus besides, you know."</p>

<p>"Are we in the war zone?" he asked with some
surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;don't you see those lifeboats swung out?
One of the firemen told me last night that this line
had lost two ships&mdash;both torpedoed."</p>

<p>"And I suppose the firemen get the worst of it on
account of being so far below?" he queried, glancing
nervously at the dim shore line.</p>

<p>"Yes. Then, you know, there are supposed to
be mines all along the coast."</p>

<p>Without comment he gnawed the last piece of
meat from the bone and tossed the refuse overboard.
Two young girls among the passengers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>above giggled at that. Strong flushed, but gave
no other outward sign of annoyance.</p>

<p>"Then we are liable to be plugged any time?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; there is a possibility."</p>

<p>"Well, if I get another dose like I got last night
I believe I would welcome it," he laughed, looking
at his blistered hands.</p>

<p>"You will soon learn how to favor yourself, and
the work won't be so hard."</p>

<p>"But you say the men who do the actual work
get the worst of things."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I think so. Firemen are the feet of the
ship, you know."</p>

<p>"I think I was all feet last night," he replied,
smiling dolefully. "I have heard professors rant
about the dignity of labor," he replied, arising with
the empty pan, having enjoyed the first full meal
he had ever actually earned. "However, I have
signed for a round trip and I'm going to stick if it
kills me," he added, half to himself, as he went
below.</p>

<p>When he came on watch at four the fire of adventure
had taken the place of Hiram Strong's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>glassy stare of debauchery. He cleaned and shook
his grates without coaching, heaving the coal well
back in the fire-box. I knew that every bone and
muscle of his body was crying out in protest. Later
I saw blood from the blisters show through the cotton
gloves, but he worked stolidly, silent and grim.
Surely he was game.</p>

<p>We were getting farther south, the wind coming
hot and the boiler-room an inferno. As Strong
worked he perspired to the point of melting. I saw
him grit his teeth, determined not to show another
white feather, and when we were washing up at
the end of that four-hour watch, there was something
of unction in his remark, to himself: "Thank
God, it didn't get me this time!" Sensibly he went
to his bunk without eating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> shift was off at eight p. m. with duty ahead
at four o'clock in the morning. But not feeling disposed
to sleep just then, I began to study our position.
Twenty-four hours ago we had cleared Scotland
lightship, and I figured we were something
like three hundred miles south of New York, off
the Virginia capes.</p>

<p>The ship, as on the previous night, was wrapped
in complete darkness as we emerged from the boiler-room,
and I could just make out the shadowy form
of the officer on the bridge, who moved about nervously.
I glanced across the expanse of water but
no light could be seen in any direction. The only
activity was the sounding lead which was thrown
overboard occasionally.</p>

<p>We still had the southern head wind which made
it too hot for sleeping below, so I decided to bunk
on deck, and went below for a blanket. Young
Strong slept as though dead, even though the quarters
were close and stuffy. I was glad to escape to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>the deck with my covering. As I laid down, expecting
to doze off at once, I began to hear subdued
voices. I heard some one say: "You know, we
passed him this afternoon at three. He couldn't be
over two hours behind us." At first I wasn't sure
I was awake, for the voices were almost inaudible.
I was sure I had slept some time.</p>

<p>"Did the wireless say all were taken off?"</p>

<p>I could now make out two officers talking near
me, but they were unaware of my proximity. Then
came the answer to the question:</p>

<p>"Yes; the report came from the shore station
where the lifeboats landed, but if the subs are operating
up there, we're probably safe."</p>

<p>Manifestly they referred to some ship that was
torpedoed two or three hours behind us.</p>

<p>"That's all right, but you know well enough that
mines have been sown here for the Chesapeake
traffic."</p>

<p>"We're not due there yet, and it's a thousand-to-one
shot that we'll get by. We've passed that
spot many times. I believe that talk about mines
is all bunk. Anyway, you know the Old Man
changes his course at that point to keep the supposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>mine field shoreward. Go to bed: you'll be
bawled out quick enough if we hit anything."</p>

<p>Then all became quiet, but now thoroughly awakened,
I went down to the galley to cajole some food
from the cook. There, to my surprise, I found
young Strong on the same errand.</p>

<p>"You had a good sleep?" was my greeting. I
needn't have asked, for he looked rested and bright,
even jaunty.</p>

<p>"Five hours; it's past one now. Where did
you sleep?&mdash;I did not see you in your bunk." His
voice sounded rather chummy, as the cook relented
and helped us liberally. We told him we had both
gone off watch without eating.</p>

<p>We took the food into the firemen's messroom,
lighted by a single dark blue bulb, and sat opposite
each other, a long, narrow, oak plank between us,
picnic style. The cook enjoined us to shut the door,
to cover even the dim illumination. The closed
windows of the messroom were painted black so
that not the slightest trace of light could escape.</p>

<p>"How do you feel this morning?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I am surprised at how well I do feel. If it
wasn't for my hands I would feel fine," he replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>cordially, sort of self-congratulatory, a half smile
creeping about his non-secretive mouth.</p>

<p>"Moisten the inside of your gloves with petroleum,
and your hands will soon heal if you are careful,"
I advised quietly. "The oilers will give you
some."</p>

<p>"It is the first time in my life that my system
has had the nicotine and other bug juices washed
out of it; a cigarette tastes different now," he
exulted, though evidently looking for sympathy.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he continued, as he cornered a
chunk of meat in the bottom of the pan and tried
to sever it with the ancient cutlery, "I always
thought I could work, and now I know it."</p>

<p>"Then this is really your maiden labor sweat?"
I asked, seemingly incredulous.</p>

<p>"Say," he began, still laboring with the meat,
"I think this ship bought a job lot of sheep, and there
were some granddaddies in the lot." I smiled an assent.</p>

<p>"If any one had told me a few days ago that I
would be sitting on board a ship before an oak
plank, eating old ram with relish, and out of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>laundry vessel at that, I would have believed him
insane."</p>

<p>I laughed outright and mumbled something about
"crises in every one's life."</p>

<p>"My crisis came, all right, the other day. It was
like the sidewalk coming up and hitting me in the
face, it so upset me&mdash;oh, it was terrible. I am
surprised that I can talk about it so soon." There
was a ruefulness and disappointment in his tone.</p>

<p>I smiled encouragingly as he went on.</p>

<p>"I knew there was trouble ahead when the Governor
called me into his office&mdash;there always was&mdash;but
I expected, as usual, to win him over. I found
for the first time why men called him a 'Gold-Beater.'
I sat across a long table from him, never
before realizing how big a man he was, his chest
seemingly as broad as those of two ordinary men.
He wasn't mad, just cold and immovable. He gave
me some money and told me that was the last. I had
to get out and work or starve. What I decided to
do did not interest him. He said he didn't want
to see me again and that he didn't care whether I
went to hell or to work." Strong spoke as one recalling
a nightmare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose you have not been able to figure out
yet who is right?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I think there is little doubt who is right, but
just how long it will take me to recognize the fact is
the question. You see, the Governor was never
stingy or tight with me. That's why he was called
a 'Gold-Beater'; he has made money, but he owns
the money instead of it owning him&mdash;at least that's
what his cronies say. And there's no doubt about
the fact that I should go to work, but in the two
or three days I have had to think about it I can't
see why he waited so long. It's downright wrong
to allow a fellow to believe he's got nothing to do
but spend money and get into trouble for
years at a stretch, then stop everything all of
a sudden. I think that's where the Governor's
wrong. But, you see, I can work, and I'm going to
fool the old man." Bending over toward me, he
added, "But I don't know how I would have come
out on my first try if it hadn't been for you."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;I have done nothing but pass on to you
what was done for me when I started. Later on
you will perhaps admit that men who work with
their hands, if approached right, are more kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>disposed and even more generous than others. But
I am glad you speak English, to say nothing of
finding a good fellow," I replied, approvingly.</p>

<p>"Well, I am not only glad to find some one who
uses English, but, like the kid I really am, I am glad
you listen to me. I got such a jolt. You see, it was
the first time I ever felt the lash of the paternal
whip, and one or two cuts were enough. I now
know why the Governor is such a power among men&mdash;he
does things so thoroughly and quietly. There
wasn't any row&mdash;he was ready for me and I don't
realize yet how well he prepared things, or how
much he apparently knows of my movements&mdash;&mdash;" He
hesitated with a sorrowful shake of his head
and resumed eating.</p>

<p>"You found he was checking you up pretty
close?" said I, to urge him on.</p>

<p>"He must have known just how many breaths I
took. He said I was a poor investment: that since
my mother died when I was three I had cost him
about two hundred thousand, and he was closing
out a poor proposition. He informed me that I was
to consider myself no more a son of his; was even
sorry I would have to use his name. And the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>thousand, his share of fixing up a man that I, and
three others, ran down in the park with an auto,
was the last assessment he would stand; and before
I knew what was really happening I was leaving
without even a good-by. I knew I was going to
work, but thought I would have a last grand night
and then pull out. But do you know, that in less
than an hour, wherever I went, every one knew that
Hiram Strong, Jr., had been disinherited and kicked
out. I then learned what New York thinks of a
'has-been.' I tried to drown the thought in liquor,
but it floated in spite of my most frantic efforts.
I guess there was a good deal of the last pickle in
me when you saw me first?"</p>

<p>I laughed and Strong continued:</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm going to beat it&mdash;I've got to beat it,"
he said, closing his mouth savagely and tossing the
empty pan down toward the other end of the table.
"I guess it's about time for us to go to hell, isn't it?"
he added, lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;all we need down in that hole is the boss
with a pitch-fork tail; we've got the shovel, coal and
heat."</p>

<p>"Say, Ben&mdash;I believe I heard them call you Ben<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>&mdash;do
you think the 'Old Boy' with the forked tail
gives his furnace men four hours on and eight off,
and great granddaddy sheep stew for eats and makes
'em sleep in tiers?" he asked, as we laughed our way
to the boiler-room.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> Strong was in need of oil for his gloves,
and, left to myself, my mind reverted to the conversation
I had overheard between the ship's officers.
Shoreward, about a half-mile, I could make
out a lightship. Being somewhat familiar with the
coast, I decided it must be the Cape Charles light.
As soon as we were abreast of it, our ship changed
its course several points to the west and seaward,
just as the officer said it would. I observed this
and recalled the other officer's cocksureness that the
ship had been running by or through the supposed
mine field for months. Nevertheless I confessed to
myself a distinct feeling of anxiety as we went down
into the region Hiram had properly designated as
"Hell," to begin another four-hour draft on endurance
and vitality. Though silent, Strong remained
cheerful and never for a moment allowed
his steam gauge to drop. The draft was good,
making the work easier.</p>

<p>There is something about labor in intense heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>that calls for silence, but after an extended stillness
there comes an oppressive feeling that makes one
want to break out into a yell. Often in a steel mill
a weird howl will be started by some one, to be
taken up by others until a bedlam is created among
the thousands of workers. There is a certain rhythm
in it, a sort of boisterous chant, a good-natured protest
against conditions. Then, suddenly, it will die
out just as quickly as it started and quiet will reign
for an hour or two.</p>

<p>Such a yell had been started by an Italian standing
under the ventilator. Then it was that I learned
that Hiram Strong had a voice, and although more
than half our watch had passed, he felt vigorous
enough to join in the general outbreak.</p>

<p>As though in protest against the riotous exhibition,
the engines stopped, a circumstance that regular
firemen secretly desire, for it means a respite in
their conflict with the blazing furnace and grates,
with the excitement of uncertainty added. The
pause may continue for a minute or an hour. At
any rate the trouble in this case had been shifted to
the engine room.</p>

<p>Before the engines first stopped I thought I heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>a noise, but it wasn't loud enough to attract the attention
of others, so concluded it must have been a
slight shift in the cargo near us and gave it no
further thought.</p>

<p>Hiram accompanied me to the far end of the
furnace room for water, after which we returned
and sat down on the hot, iron-sheeted floor against
the bulkhead that flanked our station, from which
point we viewed the whole length of the narrow
corridor between the battery of blazing furnaces
that generated the ship's power.</p>

<p>"Did you ever read Dante's Inferno?" he surprised
me by asking.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not recently."</p>

<p>"A tutor made me read it as punishment. You
know, I never would study. I guess that's what
makes the Governor so sore. I tried three colleges
and flunked. I was so infernally worthless that I
wouldn't even go in for athletics; but what I started
to say was that I believe Dante must have known
about the furnace room of a steamship, when the
engines were at a standstill." He said all this with
a sleepy grin.</p>

<p>I could see what he meant. The engines had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>stopped but a few minutes when the entire fire-room
crew succumbed to a lethargic sleep. A serrated
ridge of coal two feet high extended the entire
length of the room, on which they had disposed
themselves in all sorts of postures&mdash;some curled up
like animals going into hibernation, others
sprawled out full length, and there were many who
lay as though stricken dead while in a reclining position.
Most of the crew who worked in overalls,
with bodies bared above the waist, black and grimy
to the tousled hair now matted with sweat, laid
carelessly about as in death from convulsions. In
some cases they were in such a position that the
fierce light from the cracks in the furnace doors gave
their faces a weird, deathly appearance, and after
noting this, I glanced at Hiram and saw that he,
too, had succumbed, his head resting heavily against
the supporting bulkhead.</p>

<p>A sweet, irresistible languor now dulled my perseverance
to keep awake. How long I slept was
uncertain, but I do know that I was awakened with
a start by dreaming of an immense wave, much
higher than the ship, a solid perpendicular wall of
green sea bearing us down&mdash;a veritable tidal wave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>I was sure the ship could not survive. Hiram was
tugging at my sleeve.</p>

<p>"Ben&mdash;Ben, wake up; we have struck something
and the ship is sinking!" He did not seem frightened,
just urgent.</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;What's that?" I asked, wondering if I
was still dreaming.</p>

<p>"We've been asleep an hour. The ship's deserted;
I can't find a living soul on board! Passengers,
crew, and boats are all gone!" he cried, catching me
by the arm and helping me to rise hastily. "Nobody
on board but the engine-room shift."</p>

<p>If the effect of this information on me was magical,
it was electrical on other firemen and the coal
passers. One and all seemed to hear it instantly
and made a rush for the narrow, iron stairs leading
up, which could accommodate but one at a time.
Here they fought, as if in death's last throes.</p>

<p>With a fiendishness indescribable, twelve or fifteen
men massed seemingly into one great squirming
monster, all legs and arms, kicking, striking, biting,
shouldering and trampling each other, emitting
groans and execrations in all languages. The struggle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>was to determine who should ascend the stairs
first.</p>

<p>Young Strong seemed deeply moved by this exhibition,
but stood beside me, superior, contemptuous,
little impressed with the danger. He turned
toward me, saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let 'em fight it out; she isn't going to sink at
once; she has floated an hour. It's full daylight
and good weather. Did you ever see human beings
so quickly turned into writhing snakes?"</p>

<p>"Suppose we turn the water on them," I suggested,
and we both ran for an inch hose used to
wet down the coal.</p>

<p>Hiram aimed the nozzle at the struggling mass
while I opened the valve releasing the high pressure
stream which shot forth upon their bodies. This
had a cooling effect upon all but two who were lost
to their own safety in the vicious fight over a
screaming woman. These we shoved aside, while
the prospective victim escaped. We then hurried
up the three flights of stairs to the main deck where
others were attempting to lower one of two remaining
lifeboats.</p>

<p>Strong, cool and collected, said, "The bow sunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>an hour ago. The sea is washing over it." The
damage was located ahead of the forward bulkheads
and the ship would probably float until they
gave way.</p>

<p>"We must get our bags, Strong," said I, starting
forward to our steerage quarters. He followed,
though a little dubious about taking the time. Our
quarters, though not flooded, were very wet.</p>

<p>Strong grabbed up all of his belongings that were
outside of his bag, while I attempted to free the
chain that held them to the stanchion against possible
larceny. It seemed an interminable time before
I found the key. Then we hurried back to
where a mass of fighting men were lowering a lifeboat.</p>

<p>"Good God, Ben; what is this?" exclaimed Hiram,
as we rounded the deckhouse to where the boats
had been hanging. All but one had been lowered
and apparently all would be saved but ourselves and
one officer in uniform&mdash;he was the captain! There
was no mistaking his great bulk, lumpy skin and
small piggish eyes.</p>

<p>As we approached he turned upon us as though
we had done him great injury and swore like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>pirate. He held in his hand a pistol of ancient pattern
as big as an anchor shank.</p>

<p>"I don't believe they would have stopped if I had
killed every damned one of 'em!" he shouted, as if
to overawe us, "but you needn't think you are going
to get away. You've got to stay," he added, gritting
his teeth as he moved toward us, holding the
aged shooting-iron down at his hip as clumsily as
the usual officer of a merchantman.</p>

<p>I was greatly reassured by his presence on the
ship, and also the remaining lifeboat. We were
two against one and I was inclined to consider the
humor of the situation.</p>

<p>"Why should we stay when every one else has
gone, captain?" Hiram asked this question respectfully
enough, glancing at me; then placed his grip
against the deckhouse and deliberately laid across
it his shirt, coat, necktie, hat and shoes.</p>

<p>The captain continued to focus his two ferocious
eyes upon us, and took full time in which to answer
Strong's question.</p>

<p>"Because this ship ain't goin' to sink, and you've
got to help work it over to the beach!" he fairly
shouted, unable to control himself. He was evidently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>of the old school and as appropriate on a
passenger ship as a pig in a parlor. He was unable
to see in us anything more than ordinary firemen.</p>

<p>"How can two men run a big ship like this?"
Strong asked, keeping himself well in hand, though
there was a glitter in his eye as he glanced at me,
while advancing toward the captain, who still held
the firearm in a hip position against his six feet and
two hundred and fifty pounds of flesh.</p>

<p>"That's for me to say," he shot back threateningly,
"an' if you don't do it I'll put you in irons."</p>

<p>"We can't see it that way, captain; besides, I'm
afraid&mdash;&mdash;" Then something happened which indicated
that Strong had acquired the art of jiujitsu.</p>

<p>With the litheness of a cat he sprang violently
forward, struck the captain's wrist that held the
gun, and the immense revolver dropped to the deck
with a thud. Strong quickly kicked it overboard
with the same agility.</p>

<p>"Captain, I was just going to say that you seemed
to handle that gun awkwardly and I feared it might
go off accidentally," he said, as he jumped back beyond
reach. The captain's florid, lumpy face now
ran scarlet, his eyes glaring like those of an old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>dog in futile rage. He swallowed hard but could
not articulate.</p>

<p>"You allowed the passengers and crew to leave,
but left the firemen down in that hell hole to drown
like rats. We are inclined to hold that against
you, captain," said Strong, quietly enough. "There
is one boat left and we are going along, too," he
said, turning to me as I edged over toward the
boat.</p>

<p>"Didn't I stay?" the captain was finally able to
say in a shaky voice, with some trace of a plea.</p>

<p>"Yes, you stayed, because you would be put down
for a coward if you hadn't, and if there is any
profit or glory you get it. I've traveled on ships
before when I wasn't firing," Strong replied forcefully,
but with no trace of anger, coming over to
where I was engaged in placing our baggage in the
lifeboat.</p>

<p>"But we can save the ship if you'll help&mdash;I'm
willing to pay you extra if you'll stay," said the
captain, pleading outright now.</p>

<p>"Well, that sounds different&mdash;how much will you
give us to stay and take chances?" Strong asked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>quickly, assuming a bargaining attitude, but still
assisting me to lower the boat.</p>

<p>"Why, I'll&mdash;I'll give you fifty dollars apiece," he
offered, as though making a tremendous sacrifice.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars don't look good to me&mdash;how about
it, Ben?" he asked, as we halted the boat a few feet
from the water. "The news headlines will state
that the captain went down with the ship, but two
firemen drowning with him wouldn't be worth an
agate line."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram Strong, Jr.</span>, amazed me. Surely this
was an outcropping of the Gold-Beater's blood. He
may not ever be a Gold-Beater as the term was applied
to his male parent, but he was destined to be
a gold-getter, for he displayed evidence of that
trait when he stood there actually dickering with
the captain for a sum beyond a month's wages as a
fireman.</p>

<p>The seas breaking over the sunken bow of the
vessel, and a cargo in the hold worth at least a
million and a half, he had only the captain's word
that the ship would not sink at any moment. However,
he saw by my attitude that I also thought that
the wreck could be salvaged.</p>

<p>And he also saw that the ship was wallowing in
the trough of the sea, while the lifeboat was near
the water on the lea side, and he knew that I could
handle it.</p>

<p>"You see, captain, we have only your word that
she isn't going to sink, and we have lost confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>in you. You left us three stories down there to
drown like rats. You got everybody else off and
never thought of your firemen."</p>

<p>"I couldn't think of everything, and I tell you she
is not going to sink," shouted the captain, coming
closer and pounding the rail with his big fat hand.
"I've got to get her to anchorage or on the beach,
and you've got to help. Fifty dollars is enough;
that's nearly a month's wages," he added, trying to
avoid his usual overbearing.</p>

<p>"Why did you let the crew go?" Hiram shot at
him.</p>

<p>"I didn't know the for'd bulkhead was holding
then. You know if the for'd head holds she can't
sink," he said vehemently, appealing to me this
time. But before I could answer Hiram was after
him again.</p>

<p>"And you left us to drown! Our lives are just
as valuable to us as any of the rest of the crew, and
maybe more than some of them," he said, looking
meaningly at the captain, who squirmed visibly, now
realizing that we were not ordinary firemen.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a hundred apiece. Now stop talking
and come on. We'll have to run her stern fore-most,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>and if we can keep the wheel going enough
for steerage way, the wind will blow us in," haggled
the captain like an old market woman.</p>

<p>"A hundred dollars will not interest me; how
about you, Ben?" Hiram turned to me and began
taking the lifeboat's rope from the cleet and I did
the same. "You can stay here and drown if you
want to, but we're going. The water here looks
pretty deep, and I understand when a ship goes
down it makes a pretty big hole into which we might
fall," he added as we began to lower the boat.</p>

<p>"How much do you want? I've got to save her,"
he pleaded now, walking back and forth like a
caged hyena.</p>

<p>"If you hadn't let your wireless man go you
would have had a tug or another ship here by this
time and they would take as salvage only about a
quarter of a million," suggested Hiram with a cynical
smile, stopping the descent of the boat and making
fast again. "We'll stay, but you've got to pay.
Ben here knows something about the engines and
I will shovel the coal, but you've got to give us
two-fifty apiece," he added, taking away my breath
and almost prostrating the captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>The captain began to pace the deck again, then
pausing in front of Hiram, he said, as though imbued
with a big idea: "All right, I guess I'll have to
do it, but you've got to hustle." Moving over to
me, he asked if I knew how to start the engines, to
which I nodded an affirmative.</p>

<p>"But, Captain," interrupted Hiram forcibly, "it's
got to be cash," and there came to his mirthful
mouth a certain hardness that surprised me, and
again started incipient apoplexy within the captain.</p>

<p>"If I say you'll get it, you'll get it. Isn't my
word good for that much?" he blurted out, trying
to control his rage.</p>

<p>"Captain, you left us to drown just like kittens
you would like to be rid of. Your word isn't worth
a counterfeit dollar. I wouldn't trust you for shoestrings.
We've got to have the cash&mdash;now!" There
was genuine bitterness in Hiram's voice.</p>

<p>"I haven't that much cash on the ship," pleaded
the captain, but with a sort of wolfish gleam in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"All right, then. Come on, Ben, let's get out
of this. I wouldn't take his word for one of his
firemen's rations of soup and lumpy stew, and if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>he gave us the company's I. O. U., we wouldn't get
it for a month, and they'd red-tape it to death," he
ended, starting for the ropes again.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute and I'll see," coaxed the captain,
starting up to his quarters nearby.</p>

<p>"The old liar; he's got it, all right. Say, Ben, do
you really think she will float&mdash;it seems to me the
bow is farther down than it was?" he queried me
with something of a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it will. The sea is a little higher
than it was, and that makes the ship seem lower,
but if it gets worse there may be some danger."</p>

<p>"Do you think we can afford to take the chance?"</p>

<p>"I think we can get away in the lifeboat if the
ship gets lower. I'll watch closely, but if we take
the money we are bound to take the risk."</p>

<p>"Oh, if we take the money we will deliver the
goods, but hang the money if the risk is too big."</p>

<p>"It's a fair bet. If we back in it will take the
strain off the bulkhead, but if it does not hold, we'll
have time to get away."</p>

<p>"Watch this old jockey; he'll come rushing back
with part of the money, saying that's all he could
find." Hiram, Jr., had hardly finished when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>captain came rushing down and gave us in bills
the exact amount, cheerfully, and apparently disposed
to treat us as equals.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, we're only about twenty miles off
Hampton Roads, and if you can keep a couple of
boilers hot, we'll be there in three hours, and your
job's done. The tide is right and we might be able
to get clear in."</p>

<p>We hauled the lifeboat up so that the sea would
not wash over it, but left our belongings in it, and
then hurried below. There was enough steam left
in the boilers to swing the ship, stern shoreward,
and matters looked well. I hurried to the furnace
room, where I found Hiram stripped to the waist,
working as if the ship belonged to him. He had
wisely selected the four boilers beside which was the
most coal, and seemed to forget that his hands were
sore and his body all too green for such an effort.
I aided him as much as I could and then ran back
to the engines, repeating this operation for two
hours. I noticed that the lightship off the harbor
was gradually growing plainer. The upper part of
our propeller blades were exposed because of the
ship's nose dip. We were losing a great deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>power due to that fact. Soon we picked up a pilot
and in another two hours we slowly made the harbor
on less than one leg, and we were through.</p>

<p>"The greatest job ever pulled off! No salvage
on this ship or cargo," the captain chuckled, rubbing
his hands. "Now, let's go ashore and get some
food," he added as cheerfully as would a miser
fingering gold. He had not left the wheel house
or given an order since we started. However, before
we got through washing up Hiram began to
droop and was hardly able to walk to a Turkish
bath after we got ashore at Norfolk.</p>

<p>He did not improve much, even with a good rub-down
after the bath, and I knew it was the hospital
for him. Before the doctors got through with
his examination he was in a wild delirium and they
shook their heads. It was a bad case of exhaustion,
and nothing but a strong heart would save him.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> newspapers spread on the wreck story next
morning and I read about it while sitting by Hiram
Strong's bedside in the hospital. The captain got
the glory and credit, although the man, a mere
boy, now tossing unconscious on the pillow, was the
one to whom all credit belonged. In his delirium he
muttered from time to time. Every now and then
he would say&mdash;"Ben, he was going to let us drown&mdash;drown
like rats in a trap!"</p>

<p>The nurse gently unbandaged his hands to show
me their condition. The palms were cooked&mdash;black
and seamy&mdash;like an overdone roast. But he
was now clean, and handsome, his dark, wavy hair
mounting high against the white pillow, all trace of
dissipation having disappeared from his skin. That
was fair and clear, though slightly flushed with
fever. The smile hovering about his mouth appeared
to be at the point of breaking out into a
hearty laugh.</p>

<p>Surely his first attempt at a useful life was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>a success, for which I held myself partly to blame.
If I had said "no" to the captain's proposal we
would have come away like the rest of the crew.</p>

<p>Three days found him much better, and when I
came to see him he delighted me with his cheerful
manner.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ben!" he chanted with an infectious smile.
"I would like to shake, but my hands are wrapped
up just like a petrified mummy."</p>

<p>Naturally I looked pleased that matters were no
worse, and he continued to talk.</p>

<p>"Say, Ben, it was good of you to stick, bring
me here, and then come every day to see me. I
woke up in the night and the nurse&mdash;God bless her&mdash;she
is a kind soul&mdash;she told me all about it."</p>

<p>"Hiram, as we were sort of partners in crime I
had to stick."</p>

<p>"But say, we brought the ship in, didn't we?
Sit around nearer the foot of the bed where
I can see you. My tongue is about the only part
of me I can move. Every bone in my body feels
as though it was broken twice, and every rib creaks
when I breathe. Job never had anything on me."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>He tried to laugh, but brought up short, ending with
a groan.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right in a day or two if you take
things easy."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll not stay here long, Doc or no Doc. I'm
only sore and that doesn't count for much. Ben,
do you know what I would like to have right now?&mdash;a
porterhouse steak, thick as a flagstone, smothered
in mushrooms, and I'm going to have it if
there's one in the town. By the way, what town
are we in, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Better stick here till to-morrow anyway, then
we will see how you feel," I said, ignoring his question.</p>

<p>"All right, old partner, but not a minute longer&mdash;they're
mighty good to me, but I don't like the
carbolic odor that comes floating down the hall. It
makes me think of a Long Island fertilizing plant,
or a morgue."</p>

<p>The next morning he put on his clothes, which
had been renovated and pressed, with many "Oh's"
and "Ah's" and "Ouch's," but withal he was good-natured
and smiling. Then we started after the
much coveted porterhouse and mushrooms. At first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>he toddled like an aged man, holding on to me.
The effort was painful, but in a short time his locomotion
was normal and likewise his good nature.</p>

<p>After a prodigious meal and a favorite cigarette
he again surprised me by putting a question that
was hard to answer.</p>

<p>"Where do we go from here?" he asked, looking
inside his hands, which were still in a deplorable
state.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;so soon?" I parried.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;after I came out of my luny funk
at the hospital, I had time to think things over, duly
and truly and soberly. You know, I haven't had a
drink since we left New York, and I don't want
one. This strenuous life rather appeals to me now
that I have found I have a good body&mdash;as good as
any one's&mdash;and it's got to work without getting
sore or fluffing up with blisters. Besides, the Governor
gave me the toe of his shoe and said I wasn't
worth a 'cuss,' and I am going to show him."
There was great determination in the manner in
which he blew out the smoke of his cigarette.</p>

<p>"I think we will find an employment office here,"
I suggested mildly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"Take me to it. I'm ready now," he said quickly,
though hardly able to sit up in bed, but when we
came to the employment office he hung back, insisting
that I should be the spokesman. The face
of the man in charge was heavy and florid. He
might easily have passed for a gambler, confidence
man, or race-horse tout. He sized us up critically
before he replied:</p>

<p>"The only man I need is quartermaster&mdash;ship
bound for New Orleans to take on cotton. You can
sign again there for Liverpool if you want to."</p>

<p>Strong heard what was said and I moved toward
him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I don't care what it is, so long as you think it's
all right. It can't be any worse than firing."</p>

<p>I explained to him in an undertone that the quartermaster
steered the vessel, the hardest part of the
job being to remain on one's feet four to six hours
at a time, to which he replied quickly:</p>

<p>"That sounds good if I can do it."</p>

<p>"I can teach you in a few hours."</p>

<p>"All right, let's sign," he said, coming over.</p>

<p>We went to a second-hand store, found a
book on practical seamanship, and I spent the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>familiarizing him with his duties, after
which we went aboard. He seemed keen to know
everything about a ship.</p>

<p>The captain, a jolly good fellow, asked us a few
questions, seemed pleased, winked knowingly, and
gave us a room to ourselves on deck just back of
the officers' quarters, and told us to arrange the
watches to suit ourselves. It was to be six hours
on, six off, and we would sail at eight that night.</p>

<p>The next five days went by speedily. Our course
was down the coast through the Straits of Florida
and the Gulf of Mexico to the bar; thence to the
little white lighthouse at the entrance of the Mississippi,
over a hundred miles from New Orleans.</p>

<p>I wondered at Hiram constantly. He was so
alert and apt that he never came in for a reprimand,
never again referred to his father or his future
plans, or craved liquor&mdash;an ample supply of his
favorite cigarettes seemed to satisfy him. He had
no time for stories, nor did he speak of women,
or of any escapades in which he may have been
involved. He was actually glad to be making his
way by toil. With hands all healed he became quite
normal, and was altogether a fine minded man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>While such a rapid change might not be permanent,
he appeared not only to have turned over a new
leaf, but to have lost all taste for the habits and
customs of his previous life.</p>

<p>Things went well with us and we sped along at a
lively clip. I was at the wheel on the last watch
that would take us into dock at New Orleans about
midnight.</p>

<p>"Pop has been talking some"&mdash;Strong, from the
beginning, had referred to the captain as Pop&mdash;"and
wants us to sign up for a round trip to Liverpool.
He says it's sixty dollars and fifty per cent
extra for going the submarine zone."</p>

<p>"Then I guess we must have done our work all
right," I replied, noncommittal. "What do you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben," he interrupted, "why are you married to
the sea?"</p>

<p>"I never considered that I was&mdash;I have never
been blessed or cursed by being married to any one
or anything&mdash;one has to make a living somehow."
It was perfectly dark in the wheel-house with the
exception of the tiny hooded light over the compass,
and I couldn't see Hiram's face.</p>

<p>"A fireman can become an engineer and stops
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>there?" he surprised me by putting forth a question
in just that way. I paused before replying.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;usually."</p>

<p>"A seaman can become captain, and then his
road gets very narrow and steep toward further
advancement?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, wondering what was on his
mind.</p>

<p>"It strikes me a man of your ability is wasting
his time at sea&mdash;I don't see any future&mdash;what
about wireless men?"</p>

<p>"They get ninety dollars a month," I replied,
amused and still wondering.</p>

<p>"What about telegraphing?" he then asked.</p>

<p>"Some of our best men started as operators, Edison,
for instance. I am inclined to think it's the
methodical drill they get that helps."</p>

<p>"Ben, are you going to sign up for the other
side?" he asked, as though expecting a negative
answer.</p>

<p>"Well, I think the subs are getting quite plentiful&mdash;more
than they tell us about. Don't you?"
At last I knew what he had been driving at.</p>

<p>"That settles it," said he. "I won't, either. We've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>got a stake now and can afford to look around a
little."</p>

<p>"Our stake won't last long unless we get busy,"
I warned.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm willing to work, and I don't expect to
go up on an escalator or an express elevator&mdash;but
I do want to know that the stairs lead somewhere
worthwhile. Do you get me, Ben?" he laughed.
"I'll tell Pop we're not anxious to play hide-and-seek
with the subs."</p>

<p>I did not reply, but wondered what effect "a
stake" would have on an idle man like him in New
Orleans.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> Strong's mind satisfactory quarters meant
rooms of good size, and well lighted. We finally
found connecting space in a private house. He
seemed anxious to see New Orleans, and started
out while I looked up some old acquaintances, but
I found him awaiting me at our lodgings in the
early evening.</p>

<p>"Ben, I have done it. I've paid out the money,
and I'm going to see it through," was his greeting.</p>

<p>"Paid for what?" I asked, unable to avoid smiling
at his cheerful optimism.</p>

<p>"Fifty dollars to learn telegraphy. They say
I can do it in sixty days, and when I have completed
my course I will get a job. New Orleans
looks to me like a regular place. I like it."</p>

<p>For a moment I thought he might have been
indulging in some of the mixtures for which the
Southern Metropolis is noted, but it was only the
wine of youthful credulity that did the talking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>"That's good," I assented quickly. "When do
you commence?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I have already started in. I took my first
lesson this afternoon. How did you make out?
Can you get a job here?" There could be no doubt
of his keen desire to have me stay near him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;two or three things turned up to-day."</p>

<p>"And any one of them better than going to sea,
I'll bet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as far as the money goes," I replied, reservedly.</p>

<p>"Bully, old boy!" he shouted, seizing my hand
in a vise-like grip. From then on the days were
full of interest for both of us. Hiram's intention
to master telegraphy became almost an obsession
with him. From the moment he started in he
seemed to forget everything else, and he worked as
though his welfare in this world and the world to
come depended upon his learning telegraphy in the
shortest possible time. He ate, drank, inhaled, and
absorbed the Morse system during every waking
moment, and in less than three weeks he was substituting
for a sick operator on the Yazoo &amp; Mississippi
Railroad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>Strong's was undoubtedly an intensive nature;
the height and especially the width of his forehead
clearly indicated power of concentration, which,
apparently, he had done nothing to build up. It was
the same way when he met the girl, Anna Bell Morgan,
and when an intensive man meets a comprehensive
girl there is apt to be trouble, or a wedding,
or something equally interesting. If he had spent
money with the same tenacity of purpose that he set
about learning telegraphy I do not wonder that
Hiram Strong, Sr., became tired to the bone of his
folly and would have no more of it.</p>

<p>After working a week as a substitute he blew
into quarters one evening like a cyclone and gave
me a thump on the back that made me grunt.</p>

<p>"I've got it!&mdash;I've got it!&mdash;I've got it!" he shouted,
his face aglow and his eyes snapping.</p>

<p>This time I was sure he had broken over into
old habits, especially when I well knew the lure of
that celebrated New Orleans gin fizz to which all
newcomers seemed to succumb. But again I was
wrong. Strong had simply boiled over with exuberant
spirits and he certainly had a jag on board.
His ardor not in the least dampened by my hesitation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>he grabbed my hand and shook it vigorously,
then capered about in front of me as a boy in his
teens might do.</p>

<p>"Congratulate me, Old Man, I've got it!" he
roared. "The Yazoo Railroad has offered me a
station. Quarrytown, Ben&mdash;Quarrytown, Louisiana,
is my address after to-morrow!"</p>

<p>Of course, that was pleasant news to me and
naturally I became as excited as he, so much so
that I became fearful we would jeopardize our joint
reputations for sobriety.</p>

<p>"There's only one thing, and you've got to fix
that&mdash;eh? I don't know just how: I must have
a surety bond for a thousand dollars and also
three first-class references&mdash;can we do it, Ben? Can
you do it?" he repeated.</p>

<p>I hesitated a moment, wondering how I was going
to get three first-class references for a man who
had spent a big part of his twenty-four years in
riotous living, even to the point of being disowned.
But there was no such thing as resisting him now.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't have to wait for it; that can be done
any time. But we can fix it some way, can't we,
Ben?&mdash;I've got to," he added with emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if we have a little time I think it can be
arranged," said I, soberly, wondering somewhat
over the details of the job. But he hardly waited
for my assurance before he seized me by the hand
and began dragging me about the room.</p>

<p>"Come on, let's get out&mdash;out in the air&mdash;let's
go out and have a good time," he commanded
as he got my hat and jammed it down over my head.
"It's up the river, only about a hundred miles. You
can come up Sunday. It's big enough to have a day
and night man, and I get the day job!" he added,
loud enough for the whole house to hear him as we
passed downstairs to the street.</p>

<p>The following Sunday I went to see him. His
station was delightfully located. There was enough
level space between the river and its very high
bluffs for two long sidetracks convenient for the
meeting of freight trains, which made a night and
day operator necessary.</p>

<p>Hiram was expecting me and waved his arms
wildly as I stepped off the train, but as he was busy
rushing mail, express, and trunks into the baggage
car, there was no chance for a handshake for the
time being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>The depot looked like the cabin in which De Soto
died from malaria and disappointment in 1539, although
somewhat modernized and adapted to the
needs of railroading.</p>

<p>Quarrytown was a rambling village around D.
R. Morgan's General Store, and he was Anna Bell's
father. Near the ancient depot was a considerable
stone quarry, high clay bluffs, and the Mississippi
River. Pickaninnies, starved dogs, mules, razorback
hogs and malaria seemed to thrive along with
the willow and pepper trees. The question of moment
was how long would Hiram Strong, Jr., late
of Broadway, Sherry's, and Delmonico's, be satisfied
here? In the place of porterhouse steaks there
would be sow-belly and corn bread, and a very dry
section to live in.</p>

<p>As soon as the train was out of the way Hiram
came rushing over to me.</p>

<p>"Ben, old man, you look good to me!" he exclaimed.
"I'm getting away with it; haven't
made a bull yet. Excuse me a little bit until I take
this mail over, then I'm through." Thus he greeted
me, enthusiastic and confident, then rushed away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>with the small mail bag to Morgan's store and the
post office.</p>

<p>While awaiting his return I examined a two-wheeled
baggage truck he had left standing after
being loaded from the train. This contained an
old trunk fastened with a clothes line, a bunch of
bananas, some castings for a cotton gin, three boxes
of chill-and-fever remedy, and five cases of dynamite.</p>

<p>As Strong hurried across the street his eyes shone
with anticipation from under the visor of a cheap
cap that had replaced the jaunty derby.</p>

<p>"Say, how do you like my new station? All the
white people here are mighty nice," said he, pushing
the truck toward the depot.</p>

<p>I nodded approval and helped him to push the load
up a steep incline into the freight house adjoining
the ticket office.</p>

<p>"Do you get much of that stuff?" I asked, pointing
to the dynamite.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the quarry uses quite a bit, but it usually
comes by freight and I don't have to handle it," he
said, locking the door and leading the way to the
ticket and telegraph office, located in a small bay-windowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>room facing the track. We walked
through a dingy waiting-room, in the center of
which stood a wooden box, half filled with sand,
which stood permanent duty as a cuspidor.</p>

<p>"You see, there is no hotel here, and Mr.
Morgan has kindly taken me to board with him.
The night man stays there also. Sunday is such
a busy day, especially for freights, that I can't leave
for my dinner, so they send it over to me. They'll
send enough for two to-day. You won't mind, will
you?"</p>

<p>Before I could reply the dispatcher called him
and he began taking a train order while I sat down
upon the one remaining sixty-nine-cent chair.</p>

<p>Opposite the bay-window was the regulation
standing-counter, a ticket-cabinet, and little window
opening out to the waiting-room, aged and dingy,
especially the floor.</p>

<p>"That chair will go down with you some time,"
I suggested, when he turned about after copying
the order,&mdash;and setting a red signal for the train.</p>

<p>"It looks as though it had served its full time,"
he replied, laughing, as he arose in answer to a tap
on the waiting-room door. A darky boy with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>market basket and a white pitcher stood grinning
outside with our dinner.</p>

<p>"Ben, this dinner is not like some we've had, but
it's better than the soup and mutton stew we got on
the boat. Do you know, I would rather be dead
and in torment than fire again on that boat, but I
would have stayed, though, if you had," said he,
opening the basket and setting out a liberal portion
of fried chicken and hot biscuit on the small instrument
table.</p>

<p>"We can tell only by comparison when we are
well off," I replied.</p>

<p>"That's beginning to dawn on me, also," said he,
dryly.</p>

<p>We had hardly begun eating when a big panting
Mogul stopped with her nose opposite the window
and the conductor came trotting up and signed for
the orders. He gave one copy to the engineer and
scuttled away.</p>

<p>"I was telling you about the white people here,"
he began, as we resumed eating. "Old Mr. Morgan,
who runs the store and post office, is about the biggest
man here, and his daughter, Anna Bell! Say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>boy, she is as pretty as any woman I ever saw."
Then, for some reason, he checked himself on the
"Anna Bell" subject and became absorbed in the
well-cooked dainties spread before us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was not what Hiram Strong said about Anna
Bell Morgan, but the tone in which he said it, that
raised the big interrogation point in my mind. Matters
as they stood suggested the possibility that the
youngster had plans in mind to "face the Governor"
and that Quarrytown was a place quite good
enough to settle down in if Anna Bell said the right
word.</p>

<p>A chicken leg in one hand and a hot biscuit piled
with jam in the other, he stood facing me, with an
excited glitter in his eyes. Continuing, he said in a
tense undertone:</p>

<p>"The night man is half gone on her, but he is a
German&mdash;at least has a German name&mdash;and this
place is intensely patriotic. As I told you, he boards
there and when he is not sleeping he hangs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment a north-bound freight rushed by,
and with the noise of the locomotive and banging
of the trucks over a poor railroad joint opposite the
wide-open window, together with the slapping of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>brake beams, made further conversation impossible.
He turned, watching it as though expecting
something, and as the way car passed something
did happen. I heard a metallic thud on the floor,
at which Hiram dropped his food and began to
hunt for the thing that caused the noise. Finally,
by getting down on all fours, he brought out from
between the old iron safe and the letter press a rail
spike to which was fastened by a rubber band a
piece of white paper which he carefully unfolded.
It was a train order reporting train No. 192 passing
at that time with two cars picked up at a siding below
where there was no telegraph office. Strong
sprang to his instrument and dispatched the message
forthwith. I wondered if he realized the
danger to himself from messages thrown in upon
him that way. A railroad spike weighs about a
pound, and while he was telegraphing I speculated
on what would happen if one struck him, or if by
any chance it struck one of the fifty-pound cases
of dynamite that had come by express.</p>

<p>"The conductor drops his reports that way to
save time," he said, calmly resuming his seat.</p>

<p>Hiram's days were full of things to do, therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>we never had ten minutes' connected conversation.
I would have been glad to learn the situation inside
the fellow's active mind. I don't think he knew.
He was doing honest, useful work, and received its
immediate reward in full satisfaction&mdash;his first real
satisfaction&mdash;that intoxicating lure that fans a
spark of ambition into a flame.</p>

<p>Later in the day, at a hint from Hiram, the conductor
of a refrigerator train invited me to ride to
New Orleans with him.</p>

<p>"He makes better time than the passenger," said
Hiram, who in less than a week knew all the road
employees by their first names. Somehow he took
it for granted that I had satisfactory employment
and never asked me what it was. As a matter of
fact I was employed in connection with the American
Defense League, a patriotic organization,
which was destined to throw me in contact with
Hiram Strong very often and sometimes unexpectedly.
Ours was not the kind of friendship to end
through mere separation.</p>

<p>We exchanged letters frequently. He asked me
to send him a typewriter, which, though not required
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>in the service, was "the only way to do
things right," he wrote me. I noted that his letters
avoided any reference to the night man or Anna
Bell Morgan. I wondered if it was an oversight
or intentional evasion.</p>

<p>The Yazoo Railroad had reported, as required by
law, that they had shipped ten cases of dynamite,
but only nine were delivered. As soon as I had
time I was asked to look it up, as fifty pounds of
dynamite in bad hands would make a great deal of
excitement in or about the shipping of New Orleans.</p>

<p>I was astonished to find, upon examination of the
papers, that the explosive had been shipped to the
quarries at Quarrytown, together with an affidavit
by the train conductor that he had delivered ten
cases on the platform there. This put it squarely
up to the agent, Hiram Strong, Jr.</p>

<p>On arriving at Quarrytown I found Hiram as
busy as ever, but overjoyed to see me. He was
considerably surprised when I inquired about the
lost dynamite, but he was not worried and evidently
had not been. He was looking splendid; hard work
and regular hours had accomplished wonders, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>he seemed completely unmindful of discomforts.
As to the explosive, he took me out on the platform
to where it had been unloaded.</p>

<p>"It came here," said he, "in the evening, along
with half a car of mixed merchandise about the
time I was going off duty. I had to work overtime
to put it all in the freight house. The next morning
the quarry man came for it and signed for the
nine cases which I had delivered to him. That's all
I could find and I believe that is all that was unloaded,
although the way bill called for ten," he
admitted.</p>

<p>"The stuff was locked up, wasn't it?" I enquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I locked the warehouse myself, and
carry the only keys," he replied, as we returned to
his office.</p>

<p>The place looked to me darker and more dingy
than before, but the day was gloomy. The rickety
kitchen chair had finally collapsed and was substituted
by a box covered with a burlap bag, with some
padding on the end for a cushion.</p>

<p>"How about this door?" I asked, pointing to the
one leading into the freight house.</p>

<p>"That has no lock, but I never leave here until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>the night man comes on. It couldn't get away
through here."</p>

<p>"How about this night man; who is he?"</p>

<p>"He's been here for two years. The company
must know he is all right. His name is Gus&mdash;Gus
Schlegel. I think he is too stupid to be crooked;
he knows enough to report trains at night."</p>

<p>At that moment a dark boy came to the ticket
window and reported three cars of granite on the
quarry siding, and Hiram sat down on the burlapped
box in front of his instruments and notified the
dispatcher that three cars were ready. He then
took up a pad of blank bills of lading and began to
fill them out rapidly, though in the attitude of listening.</p>

<p>"One of your chairs went on strike?" I observed,
eyeing the artistic arrangement of the burlap.</p>

<p>"Yes; Gus's avoirdupois finally carried it down.
He found an old molasses box that was so sticky
he had to cover it with burlap. I believe I like it
better than the chair; it requires less room," he
added, looking up, while changing his carbon paper.</p>

<p>The thought occurred to me that it might be the
missing case of dynamite, but I decided that was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>quite impossible. If Gus had really driven nails
into a case filled with dynamite, he would be at
that moment in Kingdom Come and an architect
busy with plans for a new station.</p>

<p>"How is his love affair progressing with Anna
Bell Morgan?" I asked, without great show of
interest.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know she hates his name, and I think&mdash;I
think she hates him, too; but these Southern girls
are so polite and considerate of one's feelings, I
can't tell for sure; besides, she is pretty deep," said
he, as one having given the matter much consideration.</p>

<p>Hiram scratched a match on the burlap covering
and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"He both sleeps and eats there, doesn't he?" I
was beginning to consider Gus Schlegel in connection
with the disappearance of the case of explosive.</p>

<p>"Yes, he eats and rooms there, but lately he
doesn't sleep much. Why, he came in here the other
afternoon and sat where you are and cried like a
baby. He said he didn't think she cared anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>for him, and that he loved her so much he couldn't
live without her&mdash;even hinted at suicide."</p>

<p>Here Hiram Strong, Jr., looked up and laughed&mdash;a
cynical laugh&mdash;as he glanced at me. His eyes
showed that he was in earnest, and evidenced a
combination of amusement and anger. He brushed
the ashes from his cigarette on the box and continued:
"I told him the river water was nice and
warm and muddy, and that the alligators would
finish the job cheaper than an undertaker."</p>

<p>"And do you know," he continued with a smile
creeping about his mouth, "it went completely over
his head, didn't even penetrate the tallow. I don't
believe a German has any sense of humor&mdash;they
only laugh at something ribald or salacious&mdash;they
make a terrible mess of simulating virtue. Then
he asked me to advise him."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I told him he had been there nearly two
years and that was long enough for her to learn to
appreciate him&mdash;that the only way was for him to
ask her and thus settle the question for good and
all."</p>

<p>"Did he take your advice?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"He wanted to know if he shouldn't speak to her
father first, but I told him the preliminary skirmish
should be with her. He decided on the spot to do
that and if she refused him he was going to leave."</p>

<p>"I suppose he got his answer?"</p>

<p>"He went over immediately&mdash;what happened
there I never learned, exactly, but I do know he
came back in about an hour squealing like a razorback
pig kicked in the ribs by a mule, and wired
in his resignation. He was an awfully poor loser,"
Hiram added, as he sealed the big yellow envelope
for the auditor. "Why, the poor dub was so sorry
for himself, he snuffled and groaned, and his breath
back-fired like a four-cylinder motor hitting only
on two."</p>

<p>"Who are his associates here, and does he have
any one come to see him?" I asked, detecting something
like resentment in his tone.</p>

<p>"No one has been here to see him since I came.
No; he is just a big boob, with this love-stuff working
overtime."</p>

<p>"Has anything whatever&mdash;however insignificant&mdash;happened
that would connect him with the disappearance
of the dynamite?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"No, not the least thing&mdash;the claim agent and I
went over that several times. There is a certain
low cunning in him, a disposition to be tricky in
small things, but there's nothing to him&mdash;just
grease. Of course, he has the wires here all night,
and I may underestimate him. By the use of a code
he might pull off something."</p>

<p>"Did the company accept his resignation?"</p>

<p>"Yes; they had to."</p>

<p>"And you don't attach any importance to his
going now, further than this love affair?"</p>

<p>Before he could reply the train he flagged for
orders pulled past the station. He obligingly took
the tissue order pad out on the platform for the
conductor to sign. While he was gone I raised the
burlap skirt covering from the box. It stuck and
I had to pull it loose to get it up. It was undoubtedly
a molasses case, a can that had fermented or
been punctured and had run out at the corners, but
to be sure I took my pencil point, gouged some of
the stuff off the side, sniffed and then tasted it. It
was mixed with grit and dirt, but it tasted sweet
and I was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Ben, take a walk over to the quarry switch with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>me. I've got to get the numbers of three cars standing
there. I will introduce you to the head quarry
man and he will tell you all he knows about it&mdash;and
that's nothing at all. Still you might get a
pointer there," he added.</p>

<p>To this I assented without comment, but wondered
why he was so careful to put everything in the
safe and lock it; also the office door, when the big
center sash of the bay-window facing the main track
was entirely raised.</p>

<p>"You have light-fingered gentry here?" I
queried.</p>

<p>"Oh, if anything were left lying around loose
it might disappear. I don't take any chances because
I leave that window open so that the conductors
can throw their reports inside. There's
one coming now," he said, looking up the line as we
picked our way over the main track and two
switches, toward the quarry under the bluff, about
two hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>"Hiram, have you any theory at all about the disappearance
of this case of dynamite?" I insisted.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it ever came here&mdash;I know
the waybill called for ten cases, and the conductor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>of the local checks up everything as it comes out
of the car on the platform, and they're careful and
good fellows, but that day he had a lot of freight; he
must have checked in another case to make up his
ten&mdash;you know there's a lot of goods packed in
cases about that size. I'm not worried; that case
of dynamite never came here, and will show up
somewhere else," he said definitely, and with complete
candor, as we approached the three flat cars
loaded with granite on the short quarry switch.</p>

<p>While he was taking the numbers I stopped and
looked back at the disreputable-looking station
house and D. R. Morgan's store and residence beyond,
the pepper trees along the highway, and the
dwindling sized houses behind them. Two or three
mule teams with cotton bales could be seen creeping
toward the station.</p>

<p>"Do you want to come over to the office and see
the boss here? I must go in and give him a copy
of these bills," he explained, looking over at a
board shanty they called an office some distance
away.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I think not. Where do they store their explosives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>Hiram?" I asked, not noticing the usual
isolated brick or stone receptacle.</p>

<p>"They tunneled into the granite bluff about four
hundred feet down the track. This road leads to
it," he replied, pointing to a cart-track which led in
that direction.</p>

<p>"You go and deliver your bills&mdash;I will stay and
make a little diagram or map of the place." He
glanced up the track at a heavily loaded locomotive
laboring down toward the station, but when
the engineer gave no signs of stopping he went
over to the quarry office, while I took out my pencil
and pad to make my map and notes.</p>

<p>As I drew with my pencil the full length of the
pad to represent the railroad running midway between
the river and the bluff, a most extraordinary
thing occurred. I could not believe my senses. The
point of my pencil sputtered like a parlor match, but
before it reached the end of the pad it exploded like
a firecracker and blackened the paper. In an instant
I recalled having used my pencil to gouge some
of the sticky stuff off the box Hiram, Jr., was
using as a seat. I then knew positively it was the
lost case of dynamite.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> an instant my senses were flogged into a stupendous
state of excitement, and my eyes must
have bulged when I looked again at the blackened
pad and then at the pencil point that had been
blown off as though it had itself exploded. Then
I thought of that crazy, love-sick Gus who had been
driving nails into the case, and I sickened. Surely
there is a Divine Providence that protects fools at
least. Hiram had scratched matches against that
case!</p>

<p>My knees shook and my hand trembled, and I do
not think I could have uttered a sound. I looked
for Strong. He was just coming out of the quarry
office. I took one long step to rush back to the station,
but saw the locomotive approaching, laboring
hard with its immense load and throwing clouds of
black smoke from its stack that slowly expanded
into an immense dirigible in the still, sluggish atmosphere.</p>

<p>Should the conductor fling his report in at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>window fastened to a spike or a piece of granite
and hit that case of dynamite&mdash;what would happen?
This had been done many times, and nothing
occurred, but the law of average must prevail
in due time. A sickening sensation took possession
of me, and I became as rigid as stone. I felt as
though ten pounds of lead was in the pit of my
stomach; my mind was filled with monstrous forebodings,
for one hundred persons were within easy
range of that case of explosive&mdash;including Anna
Bell. I could not prevent Hiram's arrest and trial
for criminal negligence if the facts became
known. But Gus was the culprit, if any one.</p>

<p>As I looked back, Hiram was approaching.
Somehow I did not want to tell him. It seemed
unnecessary, and I could save him that much apprehension.
I must have looked strange to him when
he came up to where I stood as one ossified. He
took hold of my arm, and said fraternally: "Come
on, Ben; you look as white as if you had seen a
ghost." But I could not move. I only stared at the
passing train.</p>

<p>Hiram plucked my sleeve. "Ben, you look as
though you were standing before a firing squad&mdash;just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>as I must have looked when the Gold-Beater
told me to 'git up and git.'"</p>

<p>I could only raise my hand warningly and stare
at the passing train. It seemed to me the longest
train I ever knew one locomotive to haul, and
though it was moving at least twenty miles per hour
it appeared to creep.</p>

<p>I raised my hand to my forehead and found it
dripping with perspiration; Hiram grabbed my
shoulders with both hands and shook me.</p>

<p>"Ben, have you gone stark mad?"</p>

<p>I had forgotten he was there and scarcely heard
or felt him. I saw the way-car emerge from the
trees and approach the station. I could not help
raising my arm and point that way and did not
lower it until we were both thrown violently to the
ground.</p>

<p>It is useless to try to describe the crashing of the
intonation on my ears. I thought my hearing was
destroyed. Before the concussion threw us prone
there was a fleeting impression of a dense red flame
that came from the station. The instant the way-car
passed it was lifted from the track. I afterward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>learned it was detached from the cars ahead and
rolled over twice.</p>

<p>The man who said there are words to describe
everything groveled in ignorance. I saw Hiram
running toward the station; he fairly flew, his legs
moving rapidly as though motor-driven. I saw he
did not even relax his speed when he ran around
the deep hole where the station had stood a few
moments before, but continued to D. R. Morgan's
store and beyond that to the residence&mdash;or maybe
he was going to the river to do as he had advised
the love-sick Gus. I only know what he told me
about it afterward. How the conductor and rear
brakeman, after being rattled about in the way-car
as dice in a box, escaped with only bruises and cuts
was a wonder to me, and when I finally learned that
the fatalities were confined to a team of mules
forced through the front of Morgan's store, my relief
was immense.</p>

<p>Gus escaped from the Morgan house in his night
shirt, and ran down under the river bank, cowering
and cringing, along with most of the black population.
It was difficult to convince him he could
go back to bed in safety. The darkies eventually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>realized that it was not Gabriel's last call, and were
coaxed away from the protecting bank to help remove
the mules from the front of Morgan's wrecked
store.</p>

<p>When Hiram returned from the Morgan residence
he was fairly composed. He came to me at
once.</p>

<p>"This is pretty bad business; was any one killed?"
he asked, bracing himself.</p>

<p>"No, but it is a marvel."</p>

<p>"They will blame me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, likely, at first. Make no statement to any
one. Was your safe locked? How about cash and
station records?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is always locked; kept everything there
since Gus acted luny; but hasn't it been destroyed?"</p>

<p>"We'll go and see."</p>

<p>The hole where once stood the depot would easily
contain a freight house and more. Rails of the main
track were ripped up and twisted as though made
of wheat straw. We found the safe apparently
intact, sticking out of the débris.</p>

<p>Railroad tickets were scattered about like fallen
leaves. When he found his ticket stamp he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>greatly relieved and almost laughed. How had he
suddenly acquired such fortitude and acumen? Was
it the Gold-Beater's blood unleashed by work and
decent living? When we found parts of the new
typewriter he laughed grimly, tossing his head
backward.</p>

<p>I thought it best for Hiram that he should not
know how it happened until after he was grilled, as
I knew he would soon be.</p>

<p>The Yazoo railroad did one thing quickly and
well. In less than an hour they had a wrecker on
the job, and by utilizing the outside track had established
a detour which let Superintendent Kitchell's
"special" through from the north.</p>

<p>The wrecker reached into the débris with its long
steel arm, picked up the safe, and swung it into the
superintendent's car. He told Hiram and Gus they
were relieved, and to come with him to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Hiram obeyed the order without a murmur, but
nevertheless took plenty of time to pack all of his
belongings. He seemed to know he was through
in Quarrytown. I suspected he was rather deliberate
in bidding the Morgan family good-by, taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>some time to do it, and was apparently much excited
and flushed when he boarded the superintendent's
car and waved a cordial good-by to a
girlish figure who stood in front of the Morgan
store waving back at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is something about the duties and ambitions
of a railroad superintendent that make him
wish to appear inscrutable. The reason, perhaps, is
the man behind him who wants his job, or the man
ahead whose job he wants&mdash;or both. Anyhow, an
attempt at inscrutability is the typical refuge for
the ignorant and the smaller the road the more
futile the attempt. Though I established my identity
and purpose beyond a doubt, he at first refused
to allow me passage to New Orleans in his car.
He seemed to be suspicious of me, perhaps that I
intended to burglarize the safe, make off before
his eyes with a locomotive or some of the numerous
scrap iron along the right-of-way. However,
he finally became rational and reversed himself.</p>

<p>His car was divided about the center, one end
being private to himself and his clerk. The other
part was sort of a reception room, the "anxious"
seat for subordinates. In this apartment they had
placed the safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>After we left Quarrytown, his undersized clerk
emerged from the private quarters and requested
Hiram to open the safe, which he did promptly and
with a firm hand. The clerk took the contents to the
superintendent. Meanwhile Gus wore a very red
face and sighed repeatedly, as though already on
the way to the penitentiary instead of New Orleans.</p>

<p>After examination of Hiram's records Gus was
called in before the Superintendent and given the
third degree. When he came out he was muchly
upset and perspiring. Hiram, disgusted, looked
upon him with contempt, which feeling was intensified
when the flabby Gus dropped into a chair and
glared back at him ominously. It may have been
because of the high speed of the light engine and the
solitary car, but I surely saw Gus's knees knock together
from sheer fright. He had likely overstated
his alibi in an abandoned and frantic attempt
to protect himself to Hiram's disadvantage.</p>

<p>When the superintendent's clerk finally came to
the door and beckoned Hiram, the latter's attitude
pleased me. Neither defiant nor disrespectful, he
walked into the presence of his superior, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>he emerged from the interview he had not changed
a hair.</p>

<p>Presently the little clerk stuck his head out of the
dividing door and beckoned to me in the same curt
manner he had signaled the two men who were under
suspicion. I had no notion of being placed in the
same category and made it clear to the clerk that
such was the case. At once he became civil and
led the way.</p>

<p>When I entered his sanctum the superintendent
sat facing me at the flat top desk in the corner of
the car. He was a short, stocky man, and evidenced
much perturbation of mind by mopping his
florid face. A Flounder had been clapped on his
head and when it came away it brought all the hair
under it, leaving only a slight fringe. His lips and
cherubic mouth were pursed and screwed up to
simulate an executive air. As he jerked his thumb
indicating a wicker chair opposite him, I noticed the
little clerk sat at a small desk at the side of the car,
with notebook and pencil poised significantly.</p>

<p>"What have you to say about this matter?" he
asked without delay, withdrawing his eyes and winking
violently as soon as they met mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing," I answered good naturedly.</p>

<p>"I understand you were here investigating the
loss of the dynamite when the explosion occurred.
Have you no theory as to how it occurred?"</p>

<p>"No, I have no theory: I <em>know</em> how it occurred."</p>

<p>"Would you"&mdash;he hesitated, looking down and
bringing his chubby hands together before him&mdash;"would
you mind telling me what you know about
it?"</p>

<p>"My information will not be available to the
railroad through me, but if you will dismiss your
clerk, I will give you, as man to man, enough information
to ease your mind." In saying this I
was thinking only of Hiram.</p>

<p>After some hesitation, he nodded to the expectant
clerk, who rose instantly and left the apartment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor&mdash;I believe you said your name was
Taylor&mdash;this matter has upset me, and I may have
been rude," he apologized, and lapsed into the attitude
of a very decent fellow with troubles of his
own. I then gave him enough details to put Hiram
right. He was immensely relieved and pleased to
gain such valuable information.</p>

<p>"You seem to know something of this young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>Strong?" he queried. My reply was that I thought
I had a very good line on Hiram Strong, Jr.</p>

<p>"His cash and station records are as clean and
straight as a pin&mdash;he seems to be rather under-classed
and is capable of better things. What are
his antecedents?" The superintendent's interest was
aroused.</p>

<p>"My knowledge does not extend beyond his
father, a Southerner, now a prominent financier in
New York. It appears he decided that the only way
to make something of this boy was to throw him
out entirely on his own resources, and apparently
the old gentleman's reasoning was good."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right; there is good blood in
him. Our big trouble is in making good railroad
men from material without any blood base. We
frequently have to make 'a silk purse from a sow's
ear,' which is generally considered impossible&mdash;but
we do it. Now the case of this other fellow&mdash;can
you conceive of a full grown man with no better
sense than to take a fifty-pound case of dynamite,
drive nails into it, and then use it as a chair? But
I am greatly relieved to know just how it happened,
and if I can ever be of any service to you, don't fail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>to make it known&mdash;will you?" he asked, rising formally,
to end the audience.</p>

<p>When I came out Hiram glanced at me searchingly,
as though he would learn something from my
attitude. He had been absorbing information from
the train conductor. Hiram had developed a penchant
for burrowing into the confidence of every
one and getting inside knowledge of their difficulties.</p>

<p>At this time we succeeded in running around a
freight train that had been holding us back, and
entered New Orleans so fast that conversation was
quite impossible.</p>

<p>Before we reached the station the clerk came
out and told Hiram and Gus to report at the office
at nine the next morning, at which Hiram became
thoughtful, but not downcast.</p>

<p>He was able to get his old room next to mine,
which pleased him, and after opening the connecting
door and cleaning up a bit, he came in and gave me
one of his strenuous whacks between my shoulders.</p>

<p>"Old man Ben, what do I draw to-morrow morning
at nine?"</p>

<p>"Hiram, I don't know," I truthfully replied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>working my shoulders where he had hit me, "but I
think you will be drawn and quartered and made
into good fertilizer; that's all you're fit for." At
this he began to cavort and caper about like a colt.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind telling you how I feel&mdash;I
don't give a Continental sou Marquis what I draw.
I feel like fighting wild cats and buzz-saws. Now
that Anna Bell Morgan has promised to marry me,
nothing else matters."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> and I were soon ready for the next thing
in order&mdash;something to eat.</p>

<p>"I suppose now you will want a porterhouse as
big as Rhode Island&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And as thick as a London fog, with enough
mushrooms to choke an alligator," he broke in joyously.
"Ben&mdash;I want you to know right now that
I think you are an infernal scoundrel. You know
why my brand-new typewriter blew up this morning
and started the whole of Quarrytown over into
the river, incidentally putting the main line on the
bum&mdash;and won't tell me!" he added, squaring himself
in front of me.</p>

<p>"You'd better wait until to-morrow and see what
your sentence is before you begin to accuse me," I
replied, with a solemn wink which he couldn't quite
fathom.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose the 'Sauerkraut' and I will get
bounced incontinently. But what do I care? Had
it not been for what happened this morning I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>wouldn't know that a perfectly sweet and innocent
girl really loves me. I don't care if this part of the
world comes to an end, you can't get me into the
doldrums. Besides, I know my hands are clean,
and I have done nothing for which they should
blame me, but they may be looking for a horrible
example&mdash;a railroad is a railroad&mdash;eh, Ben?"</p>

<p>Then, assuming a more serious attitude, he continued:</p>

<p>"I've got a trade now&mdash;a way of making a living.
I can walk up the street and look any man or
woman in the eye, as one who can account for himself,
who can do something useful, and at the same
time possess the love of a good girl&mdash;it's great,
Ben! Do you know anything about such things?
I shall be no man's dog in the future. Already I've
kicked the can off of my tail, to use a figure of
speech."</p>

<p>"I don't quite understand you, Hiram," said I,
recalling the fact that this was the second time he
had referred to some such handicap.</p>

<p>"I've been up there on the river where it's so
quiet that one's own thoughts are as loud as grand
opera, and I have figured it out," he began, inserting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest and moving
over to look out of the window. "Of course,
you understand, I used the word dog as a figure of
speech, but what I mean is that the Gold-Beater,
instead of making me work and learn something at
the right time, gave me money to spend, and then,
along with old women and maidens, old men, and
gentry in general, he winked knowingly, indulgently,
as I was toboganning to Hades; then of a sudden,
inside of a day, I am kicked out, and told to go
to work or&mdash;Blazes&mdash;he didn't care which&mdash;me with
my head as empty as a base drum and muscles as
soft as a jelly fish. Oh, I'm not exactly sore on the
Gold-Beater&mdash;he did no worse than a million others,
but it's all wrong, Ben," he emphasized, turning his
eyes upon me.</p>

<p>I preferred not to take him seriously.</p>

<p>"Hiram, there's a store on the corner where we
can get a soap box, and I'll try to arrange with the
police for a place in the square&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I see you are like the rest of them; your
head is like a cocoanut&mdash;a shell that you have to
open with a hatchet; then some soft, indigestible
stuff, and real brains no more than the milk space
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>inside. Come on, let's get some food," he sneered,
grabbing me by the arm, and fairly rushing me out
on the street.</p>

<p>He spent most of the evening talking about Anna
Bell Morgan and his plans. Like every man in love,
he gave me a poor idea of her&mdash;but I inferred she
was about twenty-two, and from my distant view
of her I knew she did not run to flesh. I was ready
to give her a high mark on that score.</p>

<p>"Suppose you'll marry her at once?" said I, arching
my brows knowingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not yet; she says I must make good before
she will marry me," he replied in answer to
my query, "and besides, she has plans. She wants
to learn something, too. She is coming down to
New Orleans to go to school&mdash;her father has promised
her that for a long time. Perhaps that mule
team going through the front of the store may delay
things, but not long. Anna Bell has been helping
with his books and knows a lot for one who
has always been shut in."</p>

<p>The next evening when I heard him coming up
the stairs four steps at a time I backed into a corner.
When he felt that way I knew I would get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>a thump on my back equal to being kicked by an
ox.</p>

<p>"Ben, you scoundrel, come out of there; I want
to hit you. I've got it&mdash;I've got it this time right!"
he began, reaching for me excitedly, and playful as
a young lion. "I believe it's all your work&mdash;I'm
promoted&mdash;I didn't get bounced; the big chief did
the handsome thing&mdash;right here in New Orleans!"
This was as coherent as he was able to make himself.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Hiram;&mdash;what is he going to give
you?"</p>

<p>"Going to give me? I've already got it; been at
work all day. Four tracks on the wharf. Got
charge of all the perishable freight&mdash;meat incoming
and fruit outgoing&mdash;office to myself on the dock.
First thing I did was to wire Anna Bell&mdash;then went
to it. Great job, Ben, and I'm going to like it.
Got a new typewriter to replace the one I lost.
Beats Quarrytown, and twice the money. Why
don't you warm up and congratulate me?" he
almost shouted, rising quickly from the chair and
reaching for my shoulders again, but I dodged him.</p>

<p>"Already received a wire from Anna Bell," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>continued. "She's a great girl; the best ever.
You sly old dog, you knew it was the box we were
using for a stool; I can see it now, but do you know,
I somehow feel sorry for Gus; he was just love-sick&mdash;he
didn't know half the time what he was doing.
He was not so much to blame, but Anna Bell
wasn't to blame, either, for she never led him on."</p>

<p>"What did they do for him?" I interrupted, fearful
that he would lose his breath entirely.</p>

<p>"I did all I could to save him, and they didn't
fire him. They gave him another night station
somewhere in the swamps. But say, I've got to
step pretty lively to keep up with this job&mdash;however,
it won't be so bad when I get things straightened
out," he bubbled. At first I was afraid he
had been drinking, but it was just Hiram Strong,
Jr., finding himself.</p>

<p>I had something special on for that night, or I
think he would have talked me to sleep. He made
me promise to come around the next day and see
his layout. As I left him, he began writing to
Anna Bell, telling her all about everything.</p>

<p>When I saw him the next afternoon, he had on a
hickory jumper and cap, and was bossing the final
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>cleaning of a long, roofed-over wharf, strewn with
broken cases, trash and dirt&mdash;the accumulation of
years.</p>

<p>As soon as he saw me he began to smile. He was
full of energy, urging the negro laborers to take
away the last load, so that he could leave on time.
He pointed out how he had charge of the tracks
on the wharf. The worst feature of the situation
was that he had to be there at 4.30 a. m. with Government
meat inspectors, to let the packing-house
people have their meat early, but he was through
about the middle of the afternoon, as soon as the
north-bound fruit was loaded.</p>

<p>"That means you must get out about four in the
morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I don't mind that."</p>

<p>"Hiram, it is not so long ago that you did not
think seriously of going to bed until that time."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's a fact&mdash;but," said he, sobering, "it
seems an age and appears to me now like a nightmare.
Say, do you want to make an investment?"
he asked, changing the subject abruptly, and assuming
the air of good-natured bargaining that seemed
so natural with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"There is a barrel of filings the agent told me
to sell for junk. He says a foundry can use it to
melt up. It's been kicking around here for years.
It weighs seven hundred pounds net; give me a
cent a pound and you can have it," said he, walking
over to one side of the dock, a sort of warehouse,
and giving an old dingy barrel, lying on its
bilge, a shove with his foot.</p>

<p>Mechanically I did the same, and wondered why
filings were packed in that kind of a barrel. I
leaned over to examine it more closely, and noted
the word "Filings" marked on each head. Then
I suddenly recalled that very day I had been asked
to look inside of a storage place nearby, the same
being suspected of contraband operations, and this
would offer a genuine excuse. I examined the barrel
more closely. It was very strong, and old,
scarred, mysterious. I planned to send it to a certain
suspected warehouse, and later would go there
to draw a sample, thereby gaining admittance without
revealing my real mission.</p>

<p>"Will you deliver it, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"Yes, deliver anywhere you want; will put it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>on the back of that cart right now," he replied, with
a bantering smile.</p>

<p>"All right; here is your money; give me a receipted
bill as the railroad's agent," I said, walking
around the barrel.</p>

<p>Hiram grabbed the money from my hand, and
after a parting injunction to the laborers went to
his little office in the corner. I gave the heavy barrel
a shove with my foot and rolled it over. I wet
my finger, pressed it close to the chimes on a slight
sifting that might be sand, but when I brought my
finger away it had turned black at the point of contact
and violet at the edges where the contact was
less firm.</p>

<p>I was examining it critically when Hiram returned
with the change and a receipted bill. After giving
the dray directions where to take the barrel, and
saying that he would be there soon to get the warehouse
receipt, Hiram intimated that he was through
for the day.</p>

<p>"Wait until I change my clothes and I will go
with you," he said, hurrying to the little office.</p>

<p>"You see, this is a great system," he began to explain
enthusiastically, when he returned in his street
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>attire. "These tracks hold a train of refrigerator
cars containing meat that comes in every morning
on passenger trains. The packing-house agents get
it out first thing in the morning while it is cool, for
the early market. Then, you see, fruit steamers
from Gulf and South American ports come alongside
the wharf, load bananas, oranges, and so on,
into the same cars. The refrigerator system keeps
them cool in the summer and prevents freezing in
the winter. Then they return north as special, fast,
perishable. The packing-house centers at Memphis,
Chicago, Kansas City, and Missouri and
Mississippi River points get fresh fruit each twenty-four
to thirty hours. The train has got to be out
of here before three p. m., after which I'm through.
Looks pretty nice when it's all cleaned up," he enthused,
waving his arm about the wide dock about
eight hundred feet long, paralleling the river, now
swept and clean.</p>

<p>A refreshing breeze came from Algiers across the
wonderful Mississippi, now literally jammed with
ocean-going and river vessels.</p>

<p>"I imagine it is very interesting work, but will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>require great care and diligence," I suggested, as we
walked out to Canal street and started uptown.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not so hard. The fruit is easy, but the
meat comes in with three seals&mdash;a Government seal,
the shippers' seal, and the railroad seal. Three of
us open the cars. A Government inspector breaks
the Government seal, I break our seal and the packing-house
agent breaks their seal. Then the car is
checked on the spot. You see, there is not much
chance for error that way; besides, meat is all billed
'Shipper's weight and count,' but the freight agent&mdash;you
know I am under the New Orleans freight
agent&mdash;has cautioned me to be very careful. From
the way he acts and talks I think my predecessor got
into some kind of trouble, but no more trouble for
your Uncle Dudley. What could be worse than sitting
on a case of dynamite every day and scratching
matches on it?"</p>

<p>We had now turned off Canal Street, and arrived
at the warehouse where the barrel was sent. I was
given a regular receipt, and we resumed our way
uptown.</p>

<p>"Hiram, there's something else in that barrel&mdash;it's
not iron filings; it's something that may be worth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>much more, and now I'm going to take you in as a
partner on it. Give me three-fifty, half what I paid,
and we will go fifty-fifty," I said, with little apparent
concern.</p>

<p>Hiram stopped still and looked at me keenly, then
gave me the money.</p>

<p>"Ben, if you were to tell me to jump in the river
I would, knowing I would get out and get something
for it&mdash;after that deal at Quarrytown. I started to
say what Anna Bell said about you in connection&mdash;&mdash;"
He was abruptly interrupted by our meeting
a man from the Department who wanted me at
once, so I told Hiram I would see him later.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day I returned to the warehouse, and
with great formality drew samples from both ends
of the barrel into small manila envelopes and, as
anticipated, this resulted in quite a talk with the
owner of the place, whom I interrogated closely, for
I wanted to learn just what kind of a business he
was doing, although it seemed legitimate enough.
The Department said it was worth seven dollars to
get that information, and I intended to return
Hiram's money.</p>

<p>The presumption was that some frugal machinist
had saved his bench filings until he had a barrel full
and sold it as junk. But how did it get there without
an address marking?</p>

<p>The big interrogation point was up on everything
at that time, owing to the acute stage of the war.
Steel filings were not soluble and would not blacken
my finger. The stuff looked more like rifle powder.
I finally decided to mail a sample to a chemist in
New York for analysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>The whirligig of events took me out of New Orleans
the next day to various Gulf ports and along
the coast as far north as New York. In his first
communication Hiram said he was doing fine, and
the remainder of a six-page letter was a laudation
of the charms of Anna Bell Morgan. There in New
Orleans she was realizing her lifelong ambition, and
taking a course, but he did not say what kind. Soon
after I heard from him again and he hinted at
trouble, but finished with a lengthy encomium of
the Quarrytown young woman.</p>

<p>The third letter was unmistakably a storm signal,
a cry for relief he was sure I could give were I
there; not a wail, but a courageous man's request
for suitable weapons with which to battle. "When
did I expect to get back?" Directly or indirectly
he asked this question several times in his communication,
but did not mention Anna Bell Morgan,
and by which token I concluded his trouble lay in
that quarter. When we did meet again there was
no mistaking his concern about his troubles, and his
esteem of my ability to aid him.</p>

<p>Three months had worked a most remarkable
change. There was no doubt that his buoyant optimism
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>and sense of humor had received a shock.
About his up-curving, laughing, clean-chiseled
mouth had crept a curious drooping tendency. Fear,
corroding, soul-destroying fear, had found a footing
there. His eyes had retreated under a shelf and his
black brows moved down, while his remarkably
straight nose appeared more prominent; his upstanding,
wavy raven hair evidenced neglect, and
instead of a resounding whack on my back came
the firm, sure, hearty grip of a man.</p>

<p>He would not let me look over my hat full of
mail, much of which bore many redirections and
additional post-office stamps. I had retained my
room adjoining his while away, and it was there
we were now seated.</p>

<p>"You know, Ben," he began, after leaning his
chair back against the window sill&mdash;there was a sort
of dogged intensity in the manner he raised both his
feet to the corner of the table&mdash;"the general freight
agent hinted at trouble down on the wharf when I
went there. I didn't pay much attention because I
knew I could do the work, and, being on the level,
why should I care what had happened previously?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, for a month or more everything went on
splendidly. Then I became aware that my work was
being scrutinized closely. I learned by accident that
all my records were checked and double checked,
which was altogether unusual. I seemed to be getting
under a cloud, and the cloud kept getting darker
all the time. The specials came nosing about, first
from the consigning packing houses, then the railroad
and finally the Government inspectors from
the Bureau of Animal Industry, under whose supervision
all meat is shipped interstate. I paid no attention
except to be more careful. If I did my work
right, why should I care if the packing-house agents
and meat inspectors that break the seals on the cars
with me in the morning began looking at me as
though I had horns and a forked tail concealed
about me?</p>

<p>"I lived quietly&mdash;in fact I had to. When you get
out at three-thirty in the morning, you've got to be
in bed before nine; besides, the old life doesn't appeal
to me any more. In fact, I experience loathing
and actual nausea when I happen to think of it. And
then, while my salary is pretty good now, I had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>money to spend when trying to save every cent. It
is true that for a long time I had my dinners with
Anna Bell&mdash;you know she is here&mdash;but lately I
don't even do that.</p>

<p>"Now the losses run up into the thousands&mdash;and&mdash;and
I am suspected&mdash;suspected of being a thief,
Ben&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know you are?" I asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"Well, after a lot of this mysterious stuff, the
agent, Mr. Powell&mdash;who appears to be a pretty nice
fellow&mdash;came over to my office and let it out. He
said he believed in me and had decided to tell me,
but I think it was just a smooth plan to trap me&mdash;to
make me the goat. I was shy and chary of him,
and am yet.</p>

<p>"He told me that since I came the meat cars were
checking up short, and in one instance fresh hams
were short ten or fifteen tons, and the packing-house
people, the Government, and the road's inspectors,
who have been working on it for months,
were stumped.</p>

<p>"No, he didn't accuse me&mdash;he asked me to see if
I couldn't help find some clew to the crimes. But,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>Ben, maybe you can't quite see how much alone I
feel. You were away, I don't see Anna Bell any
more, and I haven't a soul to talk with about it."</p>

<p>"Where is Anna&mdash;Miss Morgan&mdash;now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's right here, and that is the devil of it.
I was getting along fine and so was she, and she
promised, after she got a little further advanced
and I had saved a little money on which to start,
we were to be married. But, after this infernal
thing came up, I not only stopped all plans, but quit
going to see her. I made up my mind not to go near
her as long as I was suspected of being a thief."</p>

<p>"Maybe you are going too far&mdash;are you sure she
could not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is no youthful escapade, to make young
women smile and older ones nudge each other and
the Gold-Beater pull his check book with a half
hearted protest. This is a felony, a penitentiary
offense. I may be railroaded up against bars and
perhaps stripes.</p>

<p>"Anna Bell Morgan is as pure as she is beautiful,
and if I don't get out of this clean, I love her so
much that I don't want it known that she ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>knew me. It would be the act of a dog, and a downright
coward&mdash;and, I am not a coward." He
ended by glaring at me with burning eyes, as though
I might have been the author of his troubles.</p>

<p>"But, Hiram&mdash;it may be you are somewhat morbid,
and magnify the gravity of the matter&mdash;there
is always a way out for clean hands&mdash;pinch and
kick yourself into a normal condition and answer
a few questions as though it were another man's
trouble."</p>

<p>"Well, I will admit at the sight of you I do feel
better," he said, still keeping his feet almost as high
as his head, on the corner of my table. "I am on the
rack&mdash;go ahead with your third degree stuff," he
said, with a trace of a smile as though daring me,
and pulling out a plebeian pipe, began filling it.</p>

<p>"When did you see Miss Morgan last?"</p>

<p>"Five weeks ago to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Have you written or telephoned?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," I said, raising my hand in tolerant
good humor; "you feel certain there were shortages
before your time on the wharf?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know it&mdash;that's why my predecessor lost
his job."</p>

<p>"But you don't know just what has been done?"
I asked, idly fingering my mail before me.</p>

<p>"No, I don't; but Mr. Powell, the agent, said the
packing-house and railroad specials were at a standstill,
and the government was so short of men they
could not do anything just now. He also said that
he had personally asked the local office of the Department
of Justice to take it up, and while it was
something outside of their line, they promised to
coöperate as soon as they had men available. Hang
it!" he exclaimed, passing his fingers through his
hair, "it ought not to be so hard to smoke 'em out."</p>

<p>"Hiram, I will see what can be done to-morrow.
In the meantime lose that 'going-to-hell-sure' long
face, and cheer up. I've been living at Barns &amp;
Sheds for three months, taking Greek insolence and
grease at Greek restaurants until I feel polluted inside,
and want one of those&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Real porterhouse steaks," he interrupted, laughing
as though they had become only a memory.</p>

<p>"Give me a few moments to glance over this mail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>before we go&mdash;here, this ought to interest you,
Hiram," I said, discovering one from the chemist to
whom I had sent a sample from our partnership barrel
in storage.</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;how?" he asked, looking sharp as though
expecting a joke.</p>

<p>I tore open the letter, first noticing it was nearly
three months old. The chemist had replied promptly.
I read aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Your sample suffered a little in the mail and is
too small. Will you oblige me by forwarding a
larger one by parcel post? If my guess is right, the
market is particularly bare of this class of goods,
and I can assure a prompt sale at fancy prices."</p></blockquote>

<p>"You mean that old barrel of junk&mdash;those filings
you made me pay three-fifty for a half interest in
your foolishness?" he asked, with an incredulous
smile.</p>

<p>"Hiram," I began jestingly, "that barrel will make
us rich some day; but seriously, I do know it is not
castings nor junk. However, this letter is now three
months old, and perhaps our best chance has gone."</p>

<p>That night I wired a certain person a code message
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>to the effect that I was willing to handle the
New Orleans case. It was either that or some day
I'd miss being made best man at Anna Bell's wedding.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was little trouble getting the assignment;
in fact, the authorities were glad some one was willing
to tackle the case, for it had become a nightmare
and a stench, but it was a case of "don't begin unless
you can finish it." Others had given it up, perhaps
because of the press of other work. I was amply
warned that it was a hard nut to crack, and I had
a fair chance of making a failure of it. Yes, the
railroad and packing-house people would coöperate
and do all they could. I was told to go over and see
Mr. Powell, the New Orleans agent, who all but
went crazy over it, and work out a plan with him.</p>

<p>Before night I was on the payroll of the Yazoo,
with a private office and a sub-title of some sort
under the auditor, having decided to begin on the
perishable freight records, or rather it was necessary
for me to have them under my hand, as they
were set down each day, though with little confidence
that they would yield results.</p>

<p>"I don't know what kind of a clerk I can give
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>you, for the whole system is short of help, but I
will do the best I can," Mr. Powell assured me,
placing at my disposal the voluminous reports on
the cases settled, and those that were still pending,
unsettled, with the shippers.</p>

<p>There was hardly room for the female clerk and
myself to move about in the room after the perishable
records were all in there&mdash;big volumes of yellow
tissue made it look like a storehouse, though
they only extended back to the time of the first
loss.</p>

<p>In addition to this arrangement it was generally
given out that the night business on the wharf
tracks had been so largely increased by the heavy
movement of fruit that an extra man was to be put
on to work opposite Hiram, who went on at four
a. m., and came off at three p. m. As the general
office was uptown, more than a mile from the dock
tracks, it was unlikely that I would be noticed working
in the dual capacity of night clerk on the wharf
and something or other under the auditor in the
general offices. But in this we soon found we had
miscalculated.</p>

<p>When Hiram learned the arrangement he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>jubilant. In an incredibly short time he had come
to look on my capacity to clear up a mystery as unlimited.
The joy of anticipation supplanted fear,
but he did not fully recover his old, buoyant, optimistic
self.</p>

<p>He never mentioned Anna Bell Morgan, but I
was sure he thought of her about all the time he
was not busy.</p>

<p>"Ben," he began one night, laughing, "did you
send your friend in New York another sample of
those steel filings on which we are paying storage?
I believe you will soon graduate into the 'Prince
of conmen,' or a second-story worker. I tell you
it takes a pretty good man to stop me in the middle
of the street and subtract three-fifty from my jeans
for a half-interest in a barrel of junk."</p>

<p>"No, not yet, but I expect to soon."</p>

<p>But after I had been working in the dual rôle of
wharf night clerk and assistant auditor for a week
and nothing happened, he began to get uneasy, but
somehow did not doubt the final outcome.</p>

<p>We usually ate dinner together, then we would
come down to his little office in the corner of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>wharf and he would stay with me until his early
bed-time.</p>

<p>"How long are you going to stand this night-and-day
business? I don't see when you get any
sleep?" he asked, evidently edging over for some
information, not volunteered.</p>

<p>"One doesn't need much sleep on a loafing job
like this. You see, there is little to do here nights,
and less in the day time, so I manage pretty well."
I had told him little about my office work.</p>

<p>"Why can't I stay here every other night for
you, so that you can get more sleep? I can stand
it."</p>

<p>"I don't look as though I was getting thin, do
I? By the way, who is that fat party I notice about
here occasionally, who seems to be interested in
loading for Becker &amp; Co.?"</p>

<p>"You mean that fellow whose face looks like
over-ripe cow's liver, and waddles, and whose
clothes are smelly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think that is the man," I replied, smiling.</p>

<p>"That is Becker himself. He buys all the rejects
of the city's provision inspectors and almost anything
that's got grease or fertilizer in it. He used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>to load that stuff during the day, but they got to
making a fuss about his taking it through the street
and made him handle it at night, when graveyards
hold their noses. Gad, I always hate to see him
coming."</p>

<p>"Becker &amp; Co., fertilizer works?"</p>

<p>"Yes, somewhere up the river."</p>

<p>The next morning I was late and was hurrying
into the building occupied by the auditor, in which
I had my office. It contained more than four stories,
was about two hundred feet long, with a wide hall
through the center of each floor. The room assigned
to me was on the third floor, and was
reached by narrow stairs.</p>

<p>When I passed the second floor I saw Becker at
the far end of the hall talking to a young woman
clerk, and I was sure I saw him pinch her cheek,
and furthermore, I was absolutely certain that the
object of his frolicsome caress was my clerk, who
entered the office immediately after me. She appeared
to be somewhat flustered, and her cheeks
flamed with color.</p>

<p>The incident was not particularly significant, but
enough to make me want to know all about Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>Becker, of Becker &amp; Co., fertilizer manufacturers,
and also about the young woman who compiled my
data and wrote my letters.</p>

<p>I recalled that our association had been so perfunctory
that I failed to remember her name. She
took dictation well, was a good typist and her records
were neat. Withal she worked hard. Like
good oil on bearings, she made the wheels go round
without attracting my attention.</p>

<p>Ideal office assistants try to make themselves into
humanized machines. Miss Bascom had accomplished
this so well that I had to inquire about her
name even after a week's service.</p>

<p>My desk was near the hall entrance, while hers
was over near the window, partially obscured by
stacks of records. She was, on closer inspection,
more than comely, and the way she punched the
keys of the typewriter indicated she was purposeful&mdash;not
an accident. That she could allow a greasy,
uncouth man like Becker to make up to her seemed
absurd. More to amuse Hiram, I mentioned the
matter to him that night.</p>

<p>"My Heavens," said he, holding his nose between
finger and thumb, "it would take a pretty strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>stomach to stand for that fellow&mdash;but you can't
tell! Maybe there are enough dollar signs on his
face to make up for his smelly clothes and age.
But, even in my palmiest days of riot, the 'beauty
and beast' idea was a shock&mdash;too much 'bargain and
sale' to suit me"&mdash;and I believe he was wondering if
Anna Bell Morgan would ever succumb to such a
love for the sake of money.</p>

<p>"Hiram, I don't quite sympathize with your attitude
toward Miss Morgan. Are you sure you are
doing the right thing?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," he replied, thoughtfully, as
we walked down the wharf. "It may be the pendulum
has swung the other way and I am at the
farthest point away from her. But after all, that
is something one must settle for himself. She
promised to wait in absolute silence until I had the
matter straightened. And again, perhaps you don't
understand&mdash;they have a different code here."</p>

<p>I waited for him to continue, looking westward
across the shipping in the river at the setting sun,
now enlarged into a great ball of dull red fire. Another
moment and it would perish from sight behind
the waters of the Gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, Ben, down here they have a way of
making a man feel he is either something or nothing.
If something, he respects women, and must
protect them. Women are either good or bad. If
good they receive every consideration; it is expected&mdash;demanded.
The ways of New York would not
be tolerated here, and it is perfectly right they should
not be.</p>

<p>"Mormonism, and other degeneracy, usually
dubbed 'Bohemianism,' doesn't go here. Fathers,
big brothers, or next of male kin stand guard for
the women of the South. When they put a bullet
through a licentious scoundrel the judge shakes
hands with them. And it's the same way about
honor. If a man's honesty is in question he has no
business to compromise a good woman's name by
forcing his attentions upon her. When he has
cleared himself it is time enough to straighten things
out. So, if our love will not stand the strain of
waiting it's no good&mdash;not love, at all."</p>

<p>The next day at the noon hour I saw my female
clerk in a certain situation that led me into all
sorts of information. Miss Bascom of the golden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>locks was openly dangling her feminine charms before
Chief Clerk Burrell.</p>

<p>I had only to glance through an open door from
the hall on my floor into a long room occupied by
a lot of clerks of which he had charge as chief.
Evidently he was a married man, and of a species
easily susceptible.</p>

<p>I would have continued to think it was a case of
old-fashioned man hunting to win free board and
a little credit at the stores, had it not been reported
by a man detailed at my request to see just what
kind of smoke Mr. Becker was making during his
stay in New Orleans. There was a lengthy conference
that night between Burrell and Becker, of
Becker &amp; Company, with liberal quantities of gin
fizz on the side, in a private room back of a prominent
hotel bar.</p>

<p>This was exceedingly interesting and filled with
possibilities&mdash;a party of three, two men and a
woman, an unusually attractive young woman at
that, and all were interested in the movement of
freight, with this difference, that Becker might be
the chief beneficiary, and both men might be rising
to the lure of beauty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>I spent most of that night looking up the antecedents
of this interesting trio and did not go down
to the wharf, but went to bed just before Hiram
arose to go to work. Burrell, I found, lived with
his wife and two children and was inclined to be
sporty; Becker was a rounder, and the girl was
just a clerk before she came to me.</p>

<p>I heard Hiram leaving the house and had not
been sleeping long before a messenger came from
him, requesting me to hurry down to the wharf. I
had asked him to send for me the instant the next
irregularity was observed.</p>

<p>He was very much excited when I got there, as
were also the Government meat inspector and the
packing-house representative. The three of them,
together as usual, had broken the seals of a Kansas
City car of fresh sausages in ten-pound cartons,
and about half of it, from the center of the car,
was gone. This could be seen at a glance.</p>

<p>The four of us went into Hiram's little office at
the corner of the wharf. He was so furious that
he had become stoical, even sullen, which was
promptly misunderstood by the Government inspector
and the packing-house agent as proof of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>guilt. In order to protect him and get a full expression
from them I took the attitude of favoring
their view. He did not quite understand this and
felt it keenly.</p>

<p>Each of them was ready, like dogs held in leash,
to spring at his throat. But it might have been a
sorry leap: Hiram was magnificent under such fire.
Surely the Gold-Beater had given him good blood
and a fighting spirit if nothing else.</p>

<p>"Strong," I began, in a somewhat authoritative
manner, "have you preserved the railroad's seal that
was on this car?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;here it is&mdash;I have been saving and marking
every one."</p>

<p>Then it developed that the Government inspector
and the packing-house agent had been doing the
same thing, and all three were handed to me. After
that, at my suggestion, we went out and removed
the seals from the unopened door on the other side
of the car, which I took charge of after they had
been carefully marked. I then suggested they go
about their duties and routine as though nothing
had happened.</p>

<p>I had decided on a secret, drastic inquisition. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>ax must fall now and cut where it would, the details
of which shall be avoided, only so far as they
concern this son of a man who was given the credit
of beating gold&mdash;who owned the gold instead of it
owning him.</p>

<p>I could still feel Hiram's flesh quiver under my
touch when I tried to assure him, by a pressure on
his arm, as I was leaving.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact that it was four o'clock
in the morning, I began the job by summoning by
telephone the rotund and hairless Superintendent
Kitchell from his bed, and reminding him of his
promise to help me at any time. Besides, this was
his funeral anyhow, that was to be held at ten
o'clock that morning in Hiram's little office on the
wharf.</p>

<p>I then demanded the presence of every man who
had handled that car&mdash;the loaders, the icers, weighmasters,
conductors, dispatchers and the yard-men
between Kansas City and New Orleans, something
over a thousand miles of road. Those who could
not be there in so short a time must telegraph a
transcript of their records, in affidavit form. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>sworn records were finally decided on as the only
thing possible in so short a time.</p>

<p>"I will come down to the general office and start
the necessary machinery, but the time, less than six
hours, is too short&mdash;it can't be done," he said, evidently
lashing himself out of the drowse and comprehending
the magnitude of the order.</p>

<p>"The iron is hot and now is the time to strike,"
I warned.</p>

<p>"All right, we will do the best we can. I'll get
the agent and be there anyhow."</p>

<p>"No; that's just what I don't want. This investigation
must not attract attention. Your presence
there would only advertise it. After we are through
you can have all the data, and do as you wish," I
insisted, having in mind to assume an attitude that
would allow Hiram to work out his own salvation if
possible. The only way is to expose a weak or yellow
spot, so that he would see it for himself.</p>

<p>Superintendent Kitchell again demonstrated that
he was not an accident. Before ten o'clock that
morning he had accomplished almost the impossible.
The wire that Hiram worked for a while was
soon hot with sworn statements from every man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>who had anything to do with that car, from its
loading until it landed on the wharf. It remained
for Hiram, the Agent of the Bureau of Animal Industry,
and the local packing-house agent to open
the car.</p>

<p>I glanced over the mass of stuff before handing it
to Hiram.</p>

<p>The shipping clerk of the packing-house swore
that there was put in the car six thousand cartons,
each ten pounds net weight, of prime loose sausages.
This was verified by the affidavit of a checker, then
a second and third checker, before the doors were
sealed by agents of the Government, packing-house
and railroad agents. The railroad weighmaster's
figures on the track scale verified that. It was loaded
and iced in zero weather, so that no delay was
necessary for re-icing all the way to New Orleans.</p>

<p>A verified transcript of train sheets of all the train
dispatchers of both roads showed that the car came
in a solid train of perishable provisions, over the
Kansas City, Fort Scott &amp; Gulf Railroad to Memphis,
without longer pause than to change engines
at the end of each division, where it was delivered
to the Yazoo and weighed again&mdash;which weight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>tallied with the Kansas City weight&mdash;and traveled
into New Orleans on passenger time. All this without
incident or delay of any kind, and delivered on
the unloading wharf track at 2:30 a. m.</p>

<p>When I took the records to Hiram and told him
what they were, I found him going about his work
as usual. His attitude was disconcerting. Were
his hands clean? One could have taken him for a
man who had been caught with the goods. If guilty,
I had little chance to shield him.</p>

<p>He carried his head erect, his stride was sure and
determined, but he had a glitter that indicated a
tumult inside, with an attitude of suspicious aloofness.
The erstwhile mirthful smile on his lips was
now supplanted by one of sarcastic severity, but a
smile that evidently meant much. I would have
given the world just then to know what. However,
all he would say was: "Ben, this is a devil of a mess
and I am in the center of it."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving the sworn records with Hiram I
started for my temporary offices uptown. I wanted
him to have time to thoroughly digest them.</p>

<p>At that time we had not been at war long and the
public mind of New Orleans was in a very excited
condition. The big interrogation point was raised
on every person whose acts did not bear instant
analysis. Pacifists and enemy aliens were promptly
and vigorously coerced into outward decency at
least. No trifling was permitted.</p>

<p>These continued thefts from the railroad might
mean much more than a risky enterprise for profit.
I was given to understand that while time enough
would be allowed, definite results were expected
soon.</p>

<p>When I reached my office, my clerk, Miss Bascom,
seemed to be expecting me. Her greeting,
though intended to be casual, was so gladsome I
wondered if she was trying to practice on me the
same brand of coquetry she used on the chief clerk&mdash;Burrell&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>was it to be a wheedling process?
Surely I was justified in expecting something and I
awaited the onset with great interest, convinced that
she was playing a rôle. One of Miss Bascom's duties
was to prepare for me each day a record of
every car that arrived on Hiram's wharf or departed
therefrom.</p>

<p>The first sheets of outbound records of the day
were of cars from Becker &amp; Co. to Becker &amp; Co.,
Becker's Landing, Louisiana, and the time of departure
was marked 3:30. I began to wonder if
it was purely accidental that they were on the top;
then came an exciting moment when I recalled that
a car of sausages arrived at 2:30. But the insuperable
difficulty of making the transfer, replacing
the seals, and the like, reassured me.</p>

<p>I gave Miss Bascom the two slips and requested
her to get me a memo of the contents of those two
cars. As she went about the errand I wondered
how such a refined looking young woman could
ally herself with that carcass of rancid tallow whose
very clothing emitted an odor which advertised his
business.</p>

<p>Miss Bascom returned in a few moments and laid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>the two slips before me without comment, hesitating
at the end of my desk, indicating interest and
willingness to be of further assistance. On the
bottom of each slip was delicately penciled "Soap
Grease." I knew that plebeian soap grease was
worth more than prime lard had been a short time
ago, but why the precaution of shipping in refrigerator
cars?</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know this shipper&mdash;Becker
&amp; Co.?" I decided to venture, uncertain whether
Miss Bascom knew I had seen them together in the
hall.</p>

<p>Miss Bascom backed to the end of my desk and
laid a very pretty elbow on top, the better to display
her figure&mdash;palpable acting, so it seemed to me.
Her speech had a Southern accent which lends itself
to dissimulation. "Yes," she replied, "he is an important
patron of the road, and is about the office
considerably. Everybody knows him." She did
not meet my eye, but looked at the door leading to
the hall expectantly. At that moment a boy burst
into the room wholly unannounced, laid a telegram
addressed to me on my desk, and was gone as quickly
as he came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why they ship that kind of freight in
refrigerator cars&mdash;the rate is much higher," I said,
shoving the telegram back unopened.</p>

<p>"I think I heard him tell Mr. Burrell one day he
could afford to pay extra in order to receive his
freight the same day," she replied with a naïveté
difficult to simulate.</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom, stop the work you are now on
and prepare an abstract from these records of all
freight sent by refrigerator cars to Becker &amp; Co.
during the last twelve months," I requested after
weighing the chance that she might be working with
Becker and Chief Clerk Burrell and the disadvantage
of their knowing through her that an investigation
was proceeding along those lines.</p>

<p>Miss Bascom seemed unwilling to think the interview
ended or perhaps was disappointed it had
yielded so little, but finally removed her elbow, and,
nonplussed, passed her small white hand over her
eyes and hair, so unusually bronze that one might
suspect that it was "chemically pure." As she slowly
passed behind me to her desk she half murmured
to herself, "I wish I were a man."</p>

<p>"I suppose you would be wearing a soldier's uniform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>if you were," said I, assuming a semi-preoccupied
attitude.</p>

<p>"That's on the basis that a uniform makes a dull
person look intelligent," she rejoined, looking seriously
out of the window over her desk.</p>

<p>I was reading my telegram and was too much
astonished at its contents to reply. It was from the
chemist in New York to whom I had sent a larger
sample from the partnership barrel Hiram and I
had in storage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dispatch was very interesting indeed. I was
about to go down and show the telegram to Hiram,
the contents of which would astonish him more
than it did me, at least cheer him up a bit, but
when I reached the street something happened to
intensify my interest in Becker &amp; Co. I ran into a
man I very much wanted to talk with.</p>

<p>"Taylor, you are just the man I want to see," said
he. "Come to lunch with me." It was the chief's
assistant who grabbed me by the arm and led me
into a nearby restaurant.</p>

<p>"I have just left the chief," the assistant continued,
after we had seated ourselves, "and he has
given me a hard nut to crack; complaints have piled
up from wholesale and retail dealers that bad meat,
hams and lard&mdash;even horse-meat&mdash;have appeared in
this market, which bear the genuine stamps and tags
of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and it has started
a devil of a row," he whispered across the table.
"You are still working on that car robbery case, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>I thought you might pick up something for me.
Who is Becker &amp; Co.?" He ended by asking this
question so suddenly that I could scarcely conceal
my astonishment.</p>

<p>"I know there is a concern by that name, with a
plant up the river somewhere. They are quite heavy
shippers," I replied easily.</p>

<p>"You can get the freight records and perhaps give
me a line on their operations, can't you?"</p>

<p>I knew then that Becker &amp; Co. had been mentioned
in some of the complaints. Before parting
I promised to have some information for him by the
next morning.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the afternoon obtaining commercial
reports on them and making arrangements
to have their mail censored, and I did not reach my
room until dinner time.</p>

<p>The door was open as usual between our rooms.
Glancing into the other room, I saw Hiram lying on
his bed asleep, which was something unusual for
him, and there was something about his color that
drew my attention at once. He did not stir when
I came alongside the bed.</p>

<p>He was lying on his back with his head comfortably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>pillowed and his arms relaxed at his sides like
a corpse. His face was bloodless, and his high,
wavy black hair intensified by the white pillow. It
reminded me of the time I saw him in the hospital
at Hampton, Virginia, after his fearful experience
in firing on the steamer; but his body had now filled
out and was even athletic.</p>

<p>He was either very tired or&mdash;or had he lapsed into
drink again&mdash;or was it drugs?</p>

<p>Though usually a light sleeper, my touch on his
wrist did not arouse him; his pulse was regular, and
bending low, I could not detect the fumes of liquor.
No, Hiram Strong, Jr., was just tired out&mdash;worried
into fatigue that called for sleep. He was going
through the fire that either refines or destroys.
Would he stand it? That was my anxiety as I
returned to my room to prepare for dinner.</p>

<p>"Ben, is that you?" he called presently in a sleepy
voice.</p>

<p>For answer I came to the door, wiping my hands
and looking interested.</p>

<p>"I fell asleep waiting for you to come, Ben. I
want to tell you that I acted the damned cad this
morning." Then coming over, he put two strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>hands on my shoulders and looked straight at me
with clear eyes.</p>

<p>"Ben," he continued, as though suddenly realizing
he was taking himself too seriously, "I know you are
on the square with me, I know you are doing everything
you can for me, but your movements are maddeningly
deliberate. You act as though you were
an old-stager at the game and was going sure. But
I feel like I was bound hand and foot with these
fellows darting javelins into my skin every time they
look at me; and you know I can't see Anna Bell
Morgan until&mdash;&mdash;" He dropped his hands from
my shoulders and looked out of the window. "Perhaps
I am expecting too much&mdash;you cleaned up that
Quarryville matter so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Hiram, this is a big matter, reaching God
only knows how far. It involves a number of men,
clever in crookedness, and perhaps women. There's
more to it than a bone-headed, love-sick German
and a case of dynamite. The amounts involved are
big, and it must move slowly. I know how you feel,
but you've got to grin and bear it. But about Anna
Bell Morgan, I think you are foolish. If she is the
kind of girl you should marry she would want very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>much to stand by you. But if you adopt a drastic
code of your own and insist on living up to it, how
can she or any one help you in that respect?"</p>

<p>"Ben," he began deliberately, after taking a chair
and cocking himself back against the window-sill,
"I know that Anna Bell Morgan wants to help me.
I am nursing the delusion, perhaps, that she would
give one of her hands&mdash;make any sacrifice&mdash;but I
don't believe a real man, under similar circumstances,
would bid for help from the woman whom
he really loves. If this thought proves a delusion
I must stand it somehow, but I don't believe I will
ever have faith in a woman again. I am beginning
to see things differently now. I can see more and
more why the Gold-Beater was given that name by
friend and enemy. He fought fair and in the open
and took punishment without a whimper. Ben, he
made a mistake with me, but he gave me a decent
sense of honor, and lately I realize he has given me
a good-sized body that will stand real punishment.
No, sir, my 'drastic code,' as you call it, has got to
go. And now, with that out of my system, I am going
to give you a real shock."</p>

<p>Then, with exasperating deliberation, he lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>his pipe, drew his feet up on the lower front rungs
of his chair, meanwhile watching me as I walked
back and forth before him intensely interested.</p>

<p>"I am going to quit the railroad and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, you are not&mdash;not now&mdash;&mdash;" I warned.
But he interrupted me as I paused in front of him,
pointing a finger at him, and I soon saw that I might
as well have raised my arm to stay the flood of
Niagara.</p>

<p>"I expected you to protest until&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they will think&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care a damn what they think now. I've
got to do it and you've got to help me," he said with
set jaw.</p>

<p>"But just now that would be suicide&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not after I explain&mdash;I don't intend to run
away&mdash;I am going to stay right here the remainder
of my life if necessary and clear this thing up; I've
got to. But I can't do it working all day until I'm
woozy. Now, you have got to help me."</p>

<p>"But I think you are hasty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You won't think so after I have stated my case.
I am going to constitute you the court, attorney for
the prosecution and defense, and the jury; in fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>give you all constitutional rights except my right of
appeal; that will enable a quick decision and that's
what I'm after right now&mdash;before we go to dinner,"
he ended with his wonderfully contagious smile that
seemed impossible only a few minutes ago.</p>

<p>He continued to sit cocked back in his chair
against the window-sill with his legs drawn up so
his feet rested on the lower rungs, blowing smoke
at me, as I paced back and forth before him across
the room.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;go ahead," I said finally.</p>

<p>"First let me tell you why you've got to help me.
You have the know-how and more general experience,
and can do it. I take it you are 'in right' in
New Orleans. You can help me when you are
helping yourself. I believe in you thoroughly&mdash;except&mdash;except
perhaps when you go off on a little
tangent, like you did when you put that barrel of
iron filings in storage, and made me pay half&mdash;&mdash;"
He hesitated, smiling broadly. I did not reply, and
he continued, "but even that has its advantages, because
it makes me smile whenever I think of it and
that's worth something. And that brings me to the
second reason why you must help me. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>something about your long nose that seems to smell
out things pretty well, your general attitude toward
me and everything, that awakens a sense of humor.
If they put me in jail, and you come to see me, I
believe I could see the humorous side of that, even.
Now do you understand?" he asked, relieved and
confident.</p>

<p>"I am waiting to hear why you propose to resign,"
I insisted, ignoring his complimentary terms as
directed toward me.</p>

<p>"I'll make that short enough&mdash;as long as I stay
at work there I don't have time or ginger to do
anything else. I believe that Becker is the head of
the stealing&mdash;I have got several tips lately and I
believe he's the man. Several train-men, who
learned I was in trouble, informed me that his place
up the river is queer. In ordinary water it is an
island, between the track and the river, the switch
running to it over piles, and several times when they
rode cars into his unloading doors they have seen
things they believe will bear investigation. But it's
going to be hard to get into the old fox's place. He
receives by rail from here and the north, too, but
ships out everything by an old boat on the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"Now"&mdash;hesitated Hiram shrewdly&mdash;"that car
of sausage that was short the other night sat on
track One&mdash;exactly opposite two cars that were
loaded for him on track Two. The space between
cars on those two tracks is so narrow that I was
nearly killed one day between them; the time between
the arrival of the sausage car and the departure
of his cars was only a little more than half
an hour, but it was between 2:30 and 3:30 a. m.,
when no one was there, and I believe the transfer
was made in that time&mdash;do you follow me?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;go ahead. But what about the three seals
being intact when you opened the car?"</p>

<p>"I knew you would ask that&mdash;but I believe, with
help from those 'higher up,' and the seals could be
had&mdash;stolen of course. There are two hard nuts to
crack; one is the seals, and the other is to get
into his place&mdash;and that's where you must help."</p>

<p>"Now here is another funny thing." Hiram hesitated
to bring from his hip pocket an envelope.
"Some one who knew my full name sent this to me,
care of the office," and he read from a typewritten
slip of paper,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span></p>

<p>"Why does Becker &amp; Co. get freight by rail and
ship out only by water?"</p>

<p>I stopped in front of him and reached for the
slip to examine it critically.</p>

<p>"Hiram&mdash;let me keep this?" It looked like railroad
stationery.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;help yourself."</p>

<p>"Have you any plan to get into Becker &amp; Co.'s
plant?" I asked, recalling that I had not mentioned
that I suspected them, and that this was the third
definite lead in that direction.</p>

<p>"He is a foxy old rat and would take any ordinary
bait off a trap and send it to you by mail.
The only thing I can think of is a boat&mdash;maybe I
didn't tell you it is a fertilizer plant and uses lots
of dead animals. With a boat to take him some of
this stock, one might finally get to carrying his
river freight at a cut price and that would open the
door wide."</p>

<p>"But boats that will carry even a little freight
are scarce now."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that&mdash;but we've got to have a boat.
Buy it, build it, or dig one out of the mud somewhere."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>"You have made out a pretty good case, Hiram.
I will think it over&mdash;in the meantime this may interest
you," I said, handing him the telegram I had
received from the chemist. Though half fearing
it a joke, he sprang from his chair and took it
eagerly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Standing</span> in the middle of the floor Hiram read
the missive several times. He seemed amazed as
well as incredulous. Finally, as he read it with evident
desire to grasp its meaning thoroughly, his
face lighted up with joy. "Bully stuff!" he exclaimed.
Then he read it aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The larger sample of color received. The market
just now is particularly bare of this grade. Can
get you unusual price of a dollar a pound. If satisfactory
ship Morgan Line, send memo. of weight
and will forward check at once.</p>

<p class="signature">
"<span class="smcap">Morgenstein &amp; Brun.</span>"
</p></blockquote>

<p>"Then it's not steel filings&mdash;you never told me,"
he said finally, laughingly grasping my shoulders.</p>

<p>"You insisted it was filings, your railroad insisted
it was junk, and you sold it for junk as instructed,
so why the argument?"</p>

<p>"No argument at all, Ben; the Morgan Line
steamer sails to-morrow. Sell the stuff and buy a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>boat. I've saved some money, but boats are scarce
and high. I haven't enough&mdash;what d'ye say, eh?"</p>

<p>"You haven't found a boat to buy yet, and maybe
you will not need one&mdash;besides, if Morgenstein &amp;
Brun offer a dollar a pound and are in a hurry, it
may be worth more&mdash;I only asked them for an
analysis to know for certain what it was. I didn't
ask for a market," I insisted formally.</p>

<p>"But you may miss the only chance&mdash;and&mdash;we
need the money. We've got to have a boat," he said,
visibly disappointed.</p>

<p>"So far we are out less than a ten-dollar bill and
can afford to take a chance&mdash;as I say, we must first
decide definitely that a boat is necessary, and then
the hardest part comes&mdash;everything from a row-boat
up is working overtime now."</p>

<p>"Maybe you are right, but if it was up to me I
would sell it so infernally quick it would make 'em
dizzy," he replied, manifestly consumed with the
single idea of releasing himself from suspicion.</p>

<p>"Don't resign, Hiram," I said, hesitating, before
going out of the room to dine, "until I have had a
chance to speak to the Super to-morrow. I think
I will be able to arrange it so that you can be released
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>to devote all of your time to clearing up this
matter and remain in the employ of the company.
You will see the decided advantage of the plan,
later."</p>

<p>"All right, Ben&mdash;but bear in mind that as soon
as I get out of this I am going to quit 'em for
good; there's something else for me to do in this
town. The railroad game is too strenuous at best
for the returns. It's good drill and I'm glad to
get the experience and discipline, but the returns are
a minus quantity."</p>

<p>During the meal he mentioned his father several
times, to whom he always referred as "the Gold-Beater,"
but he more frequently mentioned Anna
Bell Morgan. In fact, had I not purposely changed
the subject he would have talked of her constantly.
I could not tell him I thought it a great error for
him to completely suspend communication with her.
A big city offers enticements that a country-bred girl
does not always understand at first. I could see
he writhed under the stigma of being thought a
member of a gang of crooks, and was most powerfully
propelled by two most laudable motives. He
wanted to redeem himself in his father's eyes, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>most compelling was his desire to be able to go back
to Anna Bell Morgan with clean hands. His affection
for her was deep and sincere, a mighty thing
to him, accounted for in his prominent, broad, round
chin, but difficult to harmonize with his conduct during
his first score of years.</p>

<p>He seemed to sense my perplexity.</p>

<p>"Ben," he began, with every evidence of
chastened bigness, "I have been trying to discover
one single good reason why I should impose my
personal affairs on you, unless it is because you let
me. So far, I have been unable to reciprocate in a
single instance. I feel at times as though I am a
great care and trial to you&mdash;a responsibility the
Gold-Beater would assume if things were right. I
feel as though I were on my way but with some one
else at the wheel and compass, with a disturbing and
perhaps ungrateful feeling that the navigator is on
uncharted waters, and is himself in doubt. I think
I must have a yellow streak up my back as broad
as the moral law."</p>

<p>At this I chose to assume a lighter attitude. Scanning
him smilingly, I replied, "Can't you see that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>just now, at least, my professional reputation is at
stake?"</p>

<p>"That's so, Ben. You take to investigation as a
duck to water and I believe you are much better
suited for that than sea life. But, my dear fellow,
you move so maddeningly slow and deliberate,"
said he; but I made no reply. I could have said:</p>

<p>"Real genius and cleverness apparently do move
so slow and deliberate that most any one would
feel as though he could do much better." But I
merely laughed as we arose to leave the little French
restaurant where we had dined.</p>

<p>There was no difficulty in arranging for Hiram's
release and also for transportation good on any
passenger, freight or work train of the entire system,
in order to work out a solution of the robberies
that had spread over the entire system from Kansas
City and St. Louis to Chicago, where the consignments
originated.</p>

<p>His first suggestion was that he should take a
look at Becker &amp; Co.'s plant, and he purposely
boarded a train that had a car for delivery to them.</p>

<p>After he left I went to my office in the main
building to find both an extended report and a short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>one from a man assigned to watch Becker's movements
while in New Orleans, and as I began to
read I could feel my hair rigidly standing on end.</p>

<p>My clerk, Miss Bascom, had met Becker in a
private room, known to but few, back of the bar
of a prominent hotel. For the purpose of detecting
enemy aliens many dictaphones had been installed
by the Government in such places and with a certainty,
almost uncanny, the Government possessed
itself of information that could not have been gained
in any other way.</p>

<p>As soon as I reached Miss Bascom's name in the
report I stopped short and looked at her at work
over by the window, less than twenty feet away.
If she was conscious of my undisguised wonder she
gave no sign of it. She worked so fast and dexterously
as to give the impression that she fully lived
up to the axiom promulgated by well governed corporations:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If you never do more than you are paid for, you
will never get paid for more than you do."</p></blockquote>

<p>As I looked upon her I decided that although
Becker was exceedingly ambitious, his taste was discriminating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>indeed. Miss Bascom in a good light
revealed a velvety skin and a neck, rising column-like
from her plump chest and shoulders as though
chiseled from rare white marble. A tiny ear
peeped from under a plethora of wonderful hair,
tastefully arranged, and I noticed that her nose,
chin and lips were perfect. I wondered why I had
overlooked these points of feminine charm when
she first came to me. Seemingly oblivious to everything
but the work she was doing, I wondered how
she could maintain the attitude after such an affair
as had occurred the night before. There was no
evidence of fatigue or loss of sleep, or over-indulgence
of any kind. I was astounded that a woman
of her general charm could fall for the Becker type,
and I shuddered at the knowledge that she had
gone with him to such a place. My next thought
was that she might have given out some very confidential
information. There was but one thing to
do, and at once&mdash;find out how she came to be sent
to me.</p>

<p>I rushed through the several pages of close typing,
then began again for detail and analysis.</p>

<p>She drank nothing intoxicating according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>the report. His brutal proposal, that came in due
course, she met with astonishing diplomacy and
succeeded in staving off time and place. But the
details, recorded minutely, indicated that she was
compelled to submit to his embrace. The record
revealed that the young woman had exclaimed,
"Don't&mdash;don't, Mr. Becker," indicating that the
fossilized degenerate of fifty years was trying to
caress her. It required little tax on the imagination
to know that his big, greasy hands were drawing
her tightly to his huge frame. Why had she
laid herself liable to his advances? What kind of a
game was she playing? I was on the point of calling
her over and demanding an explanation, but
there was the second report to analyze&mdash;concerning
Burrell, the chief clerk. I decided to wait.</p>

<p>When Miss Bascom left Becker the night before
at the side door of the hotel, he entered the lobby
and joined Burrell in a pretty wet dinner, spending
several hours thereafter at a questionable resort.
Evidently Miss Bascom knew something of their
whereabouts, for here she was standing at Burrell's
desk in close conversation with him, occasionally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>laughing as though recalling some ludicrous incident.
There was nothing to do but await events. She was
up to something and I determined I would lose no
time in arriving at the facts.</p>

</p><h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Hiram returned late that night he looked
as disreputable as a bull dog that had been out all
night in the rain and mud, defending his title as
a neighborhood boss. He had evidenced some cleverness
in preparing for such a trip, but when he
got through he looked as though he had overdone
it. An unbecoming cap of Bolshevik origin, nine
cents pre-war push-cart cost, flannel shirt, open at
the neck, and covered with mud from head to foot,
he reminded me of a smuggler or bootlegger who
had taken to the swamps to avoid capture. But
his enthusiasm seemed to blind him to his appearance
and to the fact that he had not eaten since
morning.</p>

<p>"Well," he began, "I believe I am right&mdash;not so
much on account of what I saw to-day, but of what
I didn't see."</p>

<p>"Yep," said I. "Go on with it."</p>

<p>"Their plant is on an island except at very low
stages of the river and then it's swamp on one side.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>It is a big place but mostly one-story. Their switch,
of course, is on a trestle built by them, and some
one has to come out and unlock a high gate before
a car can be set in. The man at the gate stated that
they do this so that there will always be a man
there to warn the train crew that the trestle is not
strong enough to support the engine." He looked
at me somewhat knowingly while filling his pipe.</p>

<p>"Well, I went inside on the car we had for them
and saw all there was to see&mdash;which wasn't much.
Their black help live in cabins on the island. Becker
is building a big addition&mdash;the car we set in contained
cement for that purpose, presumably. All of
the train-men believe that the place is phony.</p>

<p>"We saw a packet coming down the river and
the train boy slowed up a trifle to let me off near
a landing, but I made a bad jump, rolled over twice
in soft mud and came out like a cray-fish, but I
made the packet coming to town and just arrived."</p>

<p>"Fine, go on," I encouraged.</p>

<p>"The fertilizer plant shows nothing from the
river but a floating wharf. On the way down we
passed Becker's boat going up. It isn't much of a
craft, and the packet captain said it wouldn't carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>five tons and has hardly power enough to beat the
five-mile current of the river, even when empty. A
boat, Ben!&mdash;a boat is all we need to catch that fellow,
and he's the boy we're after. If some one
would offer to carry all the material he will need
for that new construction he will fall for it&mdash;and
say, I believe I am on track of one."</p>

<p>"But you are not sure of anything yet."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I am sure they got the two refrigerator
cars that sat alongside the car that was robbed of
fifteen tons of sausage, and that they use anything
that contains grease. Of that I am as certain as
any one can be without being able to prove it, and
we've got to get him, and we can't get him until
we get inside of the plant," he insisted, his jaws
coming together with a snap.</p>

<p>"He has a regular castle&mdash;moat and all," Hiram
continued, "and we can't storm it. His people are
all black and speak only Creole."</p>

<p>"What about this boat you are on track of&mdash;but
wait, Hiram, don't you want something to eat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm hungry as a wolf. I've seen the time
I would give ten dollars for the appetite I now
have&mdash;but wait till I tell you about the boat. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>some time past there has been an old fellow coming
down to the wharf to pick up bananas, those that
break from the bunches when they come out of a
ship on the carriers. After a while I noticed that
he talked good English, Creole, Spanish, French, in
fact he seemed to be able to talk with almost any
of the rats that work on the fruit steamers. After
I had talked with him I asked what he did with the
bananas. He said he kept them until ripe and ate
them. Later he told me he lived on a boat as caretaker
and had not seen his boss lately. Evidently
he has run out of money. He hinted that if he
could get his back wages he did not care what became
of the boat. I saw him again to-day and he
says he has starved long enough, and I am going
to see the boat in the morning. It is not in the
river, but is in the canal just above the Yazoo station.
And say, I've got another scheme to
make all the money we want after this matter is
settled," said he, coming to his feet as though unloosed
by a steel spring.</p>

<p>"What is it, Hiram?" I asked, amused.</p>

<p>"Wait until I clean up a bit. Then I want you
to come out with me and watch a real hungry man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>eat. I have a long story, and a good scheme. Your
blood will be on my hands if you say it isn't. How
much is a thousand feet of lumber?" he called to
me through the communicating door, just after I
heard his wet, muddy shoes go down like a cord of
wood on the floor.</p>

<p>"A thousand feet of lumber is a thousand square
feet an inch thick. In boards a foot wide and an
inch thick they would reach a thousand feet," I
explained.</p>

<p>"That's what I thought, but I can't recall ever
having been told."</p>

<p>After seating ourselves in the restaurant, Hiram,
his mind filled with many notions, began to talk.</p>

<p>"I never see a cargo of lumber go by that I don't
think of it as something immensely valuable. I
don't understand it, unless&mdash;well&mdash;of course, I can't
figure out who is to blame, but do you realize I
actually don't know what business my&mdash;I mean the
Gold-Beater&mdash;is in? I never knew whether he ran
a pawn-shop, a gambling-house, or a real business;
my knowledge of his activities is limited to a vague
impression I have, an indistinct memory of hearing
him talk one night at our house with some man&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>he was some man, too, if the Gold-Beater
brought him home&mdash;about stumpage, stump land
and market conditions. I don't recall much, for
then I was about as much interested in it as I would
now be in a divinity student's theory on Heaven
and the other place.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it's in my blood, but anyhow,
a nice, newly sawed, clean board of timber
looks better to me than anything&mdash;except a certain
girl. I figured it out to-day, that she is the only
one I don't want to disgrace. The Gold-Beater has
nothing better coming to him&mdash;if I have to go to
jail in the clean-up of this gang&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come to the point, Hiram. You're wandering
all around Robin Hood's barn," said I laughingly.</p>

<p>"I know I'm long-winded, Ben, but I've got to
speak my prologue, or you won't understand. You
know I have stood on the dock day after day and
have seen the river carry down big trees and big
logs, some real saw-logs, some days lots of them,
and to-day, up the river, I saw a great many floating
along down stream. Some of the bayous are
full of them. There's a mass of logs in that moat
back of Becker's smell factory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;what is the answer?" I asked languidly.</p>

<p>"Here's what I propose: Arrest these fugitive
logs, cut 'em into lumber and put 'em to work. I
saw logs up the river that will make a thousand feet
of lumber and they tell me even rough lumber is
worth fifty dollars a thousand. It won't take many
of them to amount to the hundred and twenty-five
dollars per that I'm pulling down monthly from the
railroad&mdash;eh? You know, just as soon as I get
out of this I'm going to marry, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But they tell me those logs have been in the
water so long they are dead sea fruit, rotten in the
center?" I interposed.</p>

<p>"I noticed that in some of them, but many are
first class&mdash;you watch me after I get out. Do
you know, I feel sure this river is going to make
me some money. I'm going to be out to-night,
down on the wharf. The packet men say that
Becker's old tub, the one we met going up this
afternoon,&mdash;called the <em>Turgia</em>&mdash;and she is well
named&mdash;goes up there every afternoon and brings
down a load in the night. I've got to find out where
she lands and what she brings down. I forgot to
tell you he gets dead animals from the city, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>barges, and has to hire a tug to take them up. A
good chance for a deal there, if we have a boat big
enough to do his work, don't you think so?" he
asked, pausing from his food.</p>

<p>"He seems to have an eye for bargains&mdash;why not
in towing?" I agreed, much impressed with his determination,
amounting to a mania.</p>

<p>"Now, there is another thing, Ben. Suppose this
old half-starved geezer's story is right, and they owe
him a lot of wages, and the boat is something we
can use, isn't there some quick, legal way in which
we can get possession of it?"</p>

<p>"He would be classed as a seaman, with wages
due, and I think there is a Federal statute to reach
such a case quickly&mdash;I will find out, Hiram."</p>

<p>"Do that, Ben, and if I don't show up in the
morning you will know I got knocked in the head
by the water-front gang, but I'm going to see what
Becker sends down here in the night, or die in the
attempt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">I had</span> to be up that night too, and I had not been
in long before he arrived&mdash;just before daylight.</p>

<p>"Ben&mdash;Ben, awake, and get up! I've got it&mdash;I've
got it&mdash;see here!" he persisted, holding a piece of
cardboard before my eyes now dazzled by the sudden
light. "Do you know what that is?" he roared,
standing on tiptoes while I gazed at it. He was
more energetic and enthusiastic than the night before,
although he had not been to bed. His eyes
appeared to be a bit bloodshot.</p>

<p>Raising up in bed, I took the piece of cardboard
and sat blinking at it when, all of a sudden, Hiram
lost patience.</p>

<p>"Damn it, Ben, can't you see what it is?&mdash;that's a
piece of a ten-pound sausage carton, and it came
from Becker's place. Now then, we've got 'em,"
he said with suppressed voice. What he handed
me was unquestionably a part of a folding box, one
of the corner locks, and a part of the end on which
there was tell-tale printing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>"You see, this sausage that was stolen was in ten-pound
boxes, and this is part of one of them," he
insisted.</p>

<p>"Where did you get this, Hiram?" I finally managed
to ask.</p>

<p>"I had to lie on one of the wharfs upstream until
after midnight when Becker's <em>Turgid</em> came slipping
down the current, like a thief, and I had to leg
it hard to keep up with her. About a mile below
she slid in alongside a Mexican, bound for Vera
Cruz, unloaded a hundred and fifteen tubs of something&mdash;it
went down on the manifest as lard, and
I guess it was grease, anyhow. On her deck there
still remained five bales of something. I wanted to
know what it was. The <em>Turgia</em> then slid downstream
to the Southern Pacific docks and unloaded
there. They billed five bales of waste paper to
New York. Yes, I got the name of the consignee&mdash;Cassinis
&amp; Cassinis, Water Street&mdash;but I wondered
how Becker collected waste paper up there
in that swamp and I didn't believe it was waste
paper. It was covered with burlap and baled tight.</p>

<p>"Do you see what this crafty old crook has done?
He took the sausage out of the folding boxes, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>he laid out flat, then baled them carefully and is
shipping them to New York to get the best price
and put such evidence clear out of the way. Well,
it cost me I don't know how many drinks of water-front
whiskey to get those watchmen in condition&mdash;there
were two of them&mdash;before I could dig into
one of the bales for a sample. I know it was tough
on the watchmen, but there you are, and as sure as
shooting Becker &amp; Co. got the stolen sausages and
we've got to get Becker before he has a chance to
try to hang it on me, or some other boob clerk.</p>

<p>"Ben, are you awake? do you understand what I
am saying?" he asked, giving my shoulder a tap
that made me sway as though kicked by a mule.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hiram, I understand. Was there a Southern
Pacific ship at the dock?" I asked, rubbing my
shoulder.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;the next ship is due to-morrow, and they're
always late now."</p>

<p>"I believe you have something really tangible.
I'll stop that shipment this morning, but you'd better
get to bed. And," I hastily added, "we must
have more than empty sausage cartons to make a
case against him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>"I know that, and there is nothing doing in the
way of sleep for me now. The old man is down at
a rummy, waiting to take me up to the canal to see
that boat. If the boat looks good to me, will you
come and look it over?" he asked, getting up and
walking the floor like a caged lion.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;meet me here at noon, and in the meantime
I'll try to learn something about the matter&mdash;&mdash;"
But before I had time to finish he was out
of the room, going downstairs two steps at a time.</p>

<p>When I told Superintendent Kitchell that morning
in his office as much as I thought good for him
to know at that time, and especially about Hiram's
plans and what he had already accomplished, his
face began to glow, and he otherwise evidenced intense
interest.</p>

<p>"Taylor," he began, without any attempt now at
inscrutability, "I would give ten years of my life
to have that robbery matter ferreted out quickly.
All the other division superintendents on the system
are laughing at me and the General Super and
President are raising Hell. It seems to me that the
boy's theory as to how to round up the gang is
good, and I will help you all I possibly can. I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>looked at Becker's plant several times while passing
and I think the boy is right. You can't really get
the goods on him without getting into his plant, and
that must be done by starting some kind of trade.
Do you think he has any chance of getting a boat?"</p>

<p>"He will, or rather may have, something definite
about that before night."</p>

<p>"I wonder&mdash;&mdash;" hesitated the man of many troubles;
"when I was up in Memphis the other day I
met the man in charge of the Illinois division. He
happened to mention that the state was killing whole
herds of tubercular-infected cattle there. I wonder
if I couldn't get a few carloads sent here and let the
boy&mdash;Strong, did you say his name was?&mdash;get in
by boating them up to him&mdash;but you are not sure
of obtaining a boat?"</p>

<p>"I feel sure we can get some kind of a boat."</p>

<p>"Here is something&mdash;Ever since we entered
the war Central and South America have been
revolution incubators, especially for Mexico.
Some never hatch but die in the shell, others
hatch but die before they can walk, then once in a
while, out of the great number one of them grows
big enough to buy all sorts of ridiculous stuff they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>think they need or want, and ship it down here.
Then they get shot, macheted, put in prison or
exiled, and a lot of this stuff is never claimed, so we
have to sell it for freight charges. We've got a
whole warehouse of that kind of junk we should
have disposed of long ago. Go down and look it
over&mdash;anything you can use I will see that you get
it pronto. We've had about everything except industry,
virtue and honesty."</p>

<p>"Wire the Illinois division regarding the slaughtered
cattle, and I will look over your unclaimed
freight. I may find something&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And do you think," he interrupted, sore to the
bone at the thought, "that it involves any one in
the offices?"</p>

<p>I hesitated, recalling that I had not mentioned
either Chief Clerk Burrell or Miss Bascom, or their
conversations with Becker. "Yes&mdash;Becker couldn't
work without some one to give him information
about arrivals and keep him posted at the river."</p>

<p>"Rotten&mdash;rotten!" he exploded; "just think of
it, a mess like this putrefying right under our noses
and we don't get wise until they smell it in Kansas
City and Chicago. And now, Ben Taylor, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>I feel sure you are on the right track at last, and
are going to make good, you seem to be moving so
maddeningly slow and deliberate." He said this
with a deep sigh from the depths of his waistband,
his chubby hand fingering a number of yellow slips
used for official railroad messages and reminding
me of the mysterious one sent to Hiram about
Becker &amp; Co. receiving freight by rail, but invariably
shipping out by water.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Kitchell, haste in this matter will be
fatal to final results," I said casually.</p>

<p>"Yes, perhaps&mdash;at any rate I hope that's so, but
I'm so damnably worked up over this matter that I
am about wild. Then another thing, I don't quite
understand why you have so much confidence in
this young Strong, though I'll admit he shows good
mettle. I recall at our first interview you said he
was well connected in the North?" said he, still
glancing nervously over the messages on his desk.</p>

<p>"Hiram Strong is well connected. He has inherited
a great pride and along with it what seems
to be honor. He feels keenly the onus cast upon
him in this matter, but has withal a saving sense of
humor. He is working out his own salvation and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>feels he is heading off an attempt to make him the
goat&mdash;to him it is simply a matter of keeping out
of jail. He has, I believe, demonstrated that he
can do head work as well as leg work, and I feel
like giving him room to turn around," I insisted,
perhaps too testily.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he is kin of this man Hiram Strong,
who was reported this morning as coming in on our
system at Chicago in his private car. Do you know,
Taylor, I wish every private car was in hell&mdash;as
though we didn't have enough trouble already! Our
passenger engines are loaded with every pound they
can keep rolling and every once in a while we get a
private car of some millionaire pork-sticker or
quick-rich, who wants to come down here to shoot
ducks or some other fool thing. Do you think it
is the same man?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"It might be."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the boy has got word to him,
and he is coming down here to raise the devil?" he
asked, eyeing me as though I might have something
to do with it.</p>

<p>"As I understand it, from the boy, he was thrown
out entirely on his own resources&mdash;disinherited&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>as far as appearances go, is completely estranged
from his father."</p>

<p>"Well, by Heaven, if he shows up here with a
chip on his shoulder, I'm going to turn him over to
you&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;I'll turn him over to
you. You know all about it, and I've had a stomachful
of educating rich men's sons, and all the other
troubles I want," he insisted, disgustedly, as I started
to go to my office.</p>

<p>"I will be glad to do all I can for you, Mr.
Kitchell. Let me know as far as possible in advance."</p>

<p>"I can tell you that right now. He is hooked to
Number Seven, and is due here to-morrow at 11:15,
unless his old special car makes her late."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> far I had regarded Miss Bascom as one of
the hundreds of others that just chanced to take the
place of the men who had been drafted from the
railroad employees. They came from everywhere,
cities, villages and rural districts, and substitutes
for man-power were in such demand that "no questions"
was the rule; no disposition to "look a gift
horse in the mouth" or even to see if they had a
spavin, ringbone, or inflicted with "string halt."</p>

<p>Very likely she may have written the anonymous
suggestion to Hiram. I did know that she entered
the back room of a hotel with Becker and had received
his embraces and proposals, which would
surely shock a maiden's ears, but admittedly she did
not drink, and she had acted with singular astuteness.</p>

<p>I knew she was flirting with Burrell, the chief
clerk, and that Becker and Burrell frequented low
places together. Altogether it looked as though she
was playing a double rôle and I was not at all sure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>just where I fitted into the planning going on in her
head, although I'll admit the latter was very attractive.</p>

<p>At once I decided to put her to a test that would
make each blonde hair stand without support, and
the opportunity came sooner than I expected.</p>

<p>As the warehouse to which Superintendent
Kitchell referred was not far away, I went there
before keeping my noon appointment with Hiram.
It was, as he said, a veritable graveyard of disappointed
hopes and plans gone wrong&mdash;bleached,
grinning skeletons of blue-sky finance and religio-political
scheming reduced to the irreducible. They
couldn't even pay the freight to New Orleans, not
to mention their Gulf and Caribbean destinations.</p>

<p>Shippers always receive money in advance for
antiquated or experimental devices from their
"bone-yard" and therefore they had no further interest.
Cannon, more deadly at the breech, airships
that would do everything but fly, rifles rejected by
shop inspectors, cartridges that wouldn't explode,
and so on. Threshing machines and engines, sawmills
and agricultural implements, cases of rifles
and cartridges and other war-like material in astonishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>abundance&mdash;but nothing apparently for
our purpose. I did observe a big case made of two-inch
lumber, heavily iron-bound, that might contain
an engine or motor, but I needed help to reach
it.</p>

<p>When Hiram returned to the room, a little ahead
of time, his pep and ginger seemed to have been
largely augmented. His energy appeared to have
no limit, but with it all there was a shade of disappointment,
or apprehension. He began at once
about the boat.</p>

<p>"<em>Fearsome</em> is her name," said he. "She is just
what we want, a dandy for our purpose, but I'm
afraid she's too big. While fitted with a propeller
and rudder, and steers from a chicken-coop up front,
she has no power. But she's a peach for size and
width!" he exclaimed, with breath no faster from
running up the stairs three steps at a time. "How
the devil are we going to get something to make her
go?" he added, sitting down in front of me, holding
his left knee between his hands, and looking appealingly
at me.</p>

<p>"How big a boat is it?" I asked, suppressing my
amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>"About a hundred and fifty feet long and twenty
five or thirty beam. Not deep in the water, but she
draws enough. She looks like an overgrown canal
boat. But I brought the captain along; he can
tell you more; do you want to see him? It's only
a matter of getting power into her."</p>

<p>"How much will it cost to get possession of her?"</p>

<p>"Well, that is another thing&mdash;the captain says
that it's to be auctioned for the crew's wages. He
hints that the owners may have gone to jail, or
back to the mountains to resume their legitimate
business as highwaymen."</p>

<p>"Who is the captain you refer to?"</p>

<p>"Captain Marianna&mdash;I told you about him. He's
the caretaker, and has been living on her&mdash;starved
out, is an Italian, has a shipmaster's license from the
Government. He has it hanging in the boat. I'm
sure he will stay with us if we want him. He is
downstairs now&mdash;want to see him?" Then, coming
toward me, he asked in an earnest undertone, "Can
we raise the money to put some kind of power in
her? I can root out the Becker crowd, clean my
slate and then make a fortune with her if we can,"
he insisted with fierce determination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>"When is it to be sold?" I queried.</p>

<p>"The time is up now&mdash;I'd say to-morrow or next
day."</p>

<p>"I don't know, Hiram, it will be a pretty big
lump to swallow. We don't know how high they
will bid it up, but perhaps, with luck, we can manage
it." I knew he was thinking of Anna Bell Morgan,
and, as a close second, the Gold-Beater.</p>

<p>The captain was undoubtedly an old salt, past
middle age, looked dependable, repeated the same
story about the boat, but not within Hiram's hearing
would he tell from whence it came, or how, or
why they brought it through the canal instead of
up the river, the usual way of getting into New
Orleans. However, I was doubtful about power.</p>

<p>As soon as the captain had gone we started for
the unclaimed freight warehouse to investigate further.
While we were on the way Hiram caught me
by the arm and, bringing his face nearly in front of
mine, half whispered:</p>

<p>"Ben, I have some money&mdash;I did not spend all
the Gold-Beater gave me as my last dot. I've
got the money we pried from the old captain
who was going to drown us, and I have saved my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>wages, but the heck of it is to get some kind of
power. No one will pay much for the boat. How
about selling that barrel? The last offer was something
like seven hundred dollars, wasn't it?" His
tone was of the wheedling variety.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had forgotten to tell you, Hiram, that
I have had some favorable news about that barrel of
steel-filings," said I, at the same time giving him a
gentle nudge. "But as soon as I can get in touch
with the right market I expect to get a much better
offer. I don't want to sell that just now, but I,
too, have saved a little money we can use if necessary."
I then explained the possibility of finding
something in the way of a motor in the warehouse
for which we were then bound, and if so, no immediate
outlay would be necessary, but of course
that was only a chance, and besides, we were not
sure some fool would not bid it well up.</p>

<p>"I don't care how fast it goes, just so it can beat
the river current," he urged. "Oh, she looks tough.
No one will bid much, that's certain."</p>

<p>"Have you figured on the fact that this boat is in
the canal, and while only a mile from the river,
you must go a long way by water to get there?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I know it is two hundred miles or more,
clear out through the Mississippi and Chandeleur
Sound, but that won't take long if she can move at
all," he replied without hesitation. "You see, it is
practically inland water all the way," he added.</p>

<p>"Hiram, are you still keeping away from Anna
Bell Morgan? Don't you hear from her at all?"
I asked this question suddenly, as we approached the
warehouse, and the change of subject appeared to
have startled him.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;and, I never shall unless this matter
is cleaned up completely. If I go to the bow-wows
I won't take any one with me," he said, looking far
away down the sidewalk.</p>

<p>"You haven't seen her for some time. Are you
cooling off?"</p>

<p>"No, Ben, not one bit. That girl is the only one
who has ever held me. I don't believe there is a
half hour of the time that I am awake I do not
think of her, and I believe it is the thought of her
that makes me fight. I tell you it must be no halfway
business. If they try to pin anything on me
and have me arrested, which they may, some people
will always believe me guilty even if I am acquitted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>And if that comes to pass I don't believe I will
ever see her again; in fact I told her so. It is
a fearful thing to think of, and while we are making
headway, the delay almost drives me wild when I
stop to think about it," he said, still downcast.</p>

<p>"You'll forget&mdash;most men do."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I may forget&mdash;I may not be different from
other men, but I don't feel that way now, and I don't
think I ever will," he replied with a certain convincing
firmness. But when we got to the warehouse,
the possibility of failure, suggested by the
reference to Anna Bell Morgan, seemed to lend
strength to his body. He lifted big cases with ease
and smaller ones left his hands with a toss until
we uncovered the big case that had attracted my
attention.</p>

<p>A sledge broke the iron binding and I lifted one
of the thick planks. When I told Hiram it was a
steam engine, and worthless to us, it was the first
time I ever heard him use voluble profanity, to
which I listened, amused.</p>

<p>But in uncovering this case, bigger ones back of
it were revealed. We went at them. The next one
we opened contained an antiquated automobile, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>worth the expense of packing for sea-shipment.
Another case that had just been unloaded from a
car that morning promised something and our hopes
arose; it was much longer and larger than any of
the others and readily answered to the blows of
the sledge. It contained the body of an air-ship.
Hiram was about to sulphurize the warehouse again
but sat down instead, wet with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Ben, that infernal thing contains a gasoline
motor&mdash;is it possible to use it?" He waited expectantly
for a reply.</p>

<p>"Perhaps; rip off another plank so that I can
see."</p>

<p>Two more blows from the flying sledge sent another
plank flying.</p>

<p>"There you are!" he exulted.</p>

<p>We were astonished to find a twelve-cylinder
motor of standard manufacture, which I thought
might be used in a boat. And, of course, a self-contained
plant, ready for running.</p>

<p>Hiram's spirits rose to the heights with this information
and he began his habit of cavorting like
a colt, apparently forgetting the sad disappointment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>of only a moment before. In many respects he was
yet a boy.</p>

<p>I called Mr. Kitchell on the telephone, told him
briefly about the boat and of the motor in the air-plane.</p>

<p>"Yes, take it, and anything there you can use;
you know we can requisition anything we want when
necessary. Take it quick if you can use it to get
us out of this nightmare," he snapped back at me.
"A complaint from Washington has reached the
president of the road, who has passed it down the
line with a stinger in every word. Both the railroad
administration and the Bureau of Animal Industry
are riding on my neck without a saddle. Go as far
as you like, only hurry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> suggested that he and the captain would
get the motor out on the floor and test it in order
to make sure that another crooked revolutionist had
not met a crooked manufacturer.</p>

<p>While they were doing this I went to my office
to get a better line on the traffic between that very
interesting trio&mdash;Becker, Burrell and my clerk,
Miss Bascom.</p>

<p>Captain Marianna helped Hiram, so they soon
had the motor on skids, and 'phoned me to come
down and try it out. The working test was satisfactory
and after computing its horsepower, we decided
it would drive the boat, and, possibly, at a
fair speed. Before leaving the warehouse Hiram
called my attention to a small portable sawmill outfit.</p>

<p>"If this works out, that's mine, too," he whispered,
evidently still clinging to the idea of capturing
logs in the river.</p>

<p>Hiram was right, nothing like the hull of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span><em>Fearsome</em> had ever been produced before. A hundred
and fifty feet long, and over thirty foot beam,
and with a bulwark not more than a foot high about
the entire outside. It looked like an immense skimming
dish. Hiram thought it came from the
canals of Mars, possibly a cup challenger there.
Captain Marianna assured us, though she didn't
look it now, she was very sturdy and seaworthy
and she did not leak even a little since he had been
on her. No doubt it had previously had gasoline
power in it, for there were left intact the foundation
beams. Hiram said that the captain, now
penniless and almost starving, if given some cash
and a good job, would likely be distinctly different
from now on. I told him I thought the fellow was
a fair bet, and left them at work getting the motor
ready to move on board. The captain assured me
the sale was to take place at nine the next morning.
No one had been around to see it and I felt sure it
would go for very little.</p>

<p>As I was up all night I did not see Hiram until
the next morning. The sale looked as though it had
been arranged for our benefit. The officer said the
claims were nearly a thousand dollars, sold it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>promptly for that bid, got away as though in a
hurry, and I attended to the details, leaving Hiram
serious but jubilant.</p>

<p>It was late that night when he returned, tired
and hungry but enthusiastic. He took little interest
in a letter awaiting him until he told me all about
his progress in moving the motor and getting it
aboard the boat.</p>

<p>"We got the motor aboard late this evening and
it fits as if made for the foundation beams, and it
will connect with the propeller shaft and clutch with
little trouble. But, say, the captain says we must
have an air compressor for the whistle and an
<span class="err" title="original: anxiliary">auxiliary</span> gasoline tank,&mdash;and, say," he continued,
while stripping down to wash&mdash;"I believe the captain
is going to prove a jewel&mdash;he's all right."</p>

<p>"You still think him reliable?"</p>

<p>"Well, if he is as loyal to us as he was to his
old employers he will be all right&mdash;and willing to
turn his hand to anything."</p>

<p>"Did you see the letter that came for you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm going to read it in a minute&mdash;it's nothing,
for I don't know any one who would write to
me. I've got something more important to do now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>than keeping up a line of correspondence," he said,
as he finished his ablutions and buttoned his flannel
shirt at the collar. Then he reached for the letter
and as he opened it his face changed to astonished
resentment.</p>

<p>"Say, who the devil can it be that is writing me
these notes? This is the second one I have received,
not dated or signed by any one. I don't understand
this one at all," he added, handing it to me.</p>

<p>I took it and read from the same yellow paper
and typed as the last one had been:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Becker &amp; Co. know of the Railroad's plan to
ship slaughtered cattle from Illinois to their plant."</p></blockquote>

<p>His astonishment was no greater than mine, for
instantly I knew that only some one connected with
the railroad and telegraph could learn anything regarding
Superintendent Kitchell's plan. I also recalled
that I had not mentioned anything about the
plan to Hiram, or any other important thing concerning
the case. I wanted him to move uninfluenced
by anything I knew or suspected.</p>

<p>After examining the note critically a few moments,
I said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span></p>

<p>"Hiram, these notes may come from a woman&mdash;they
have such earmarks. Do you know&mdash;have you
anything to do with a woman?" I asked, really
alarmed at the moment, and scrutinizing him closely.</p>

<p>Hiram stood straight before me and looked me
square in the eye with magnificent candor.</p>

<p>"Ben, I have scarcely a speaking acquaintance
with any woman in New Orleans except Anna Bell
Morgan&mdash;and I have not seen her or communicated
with her since&mdash;well, you know how long&mdash;ever
since this damned thing came up like a black fog
from Hades, out of which it seems impossible to
get&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The plan of getting into Becker's plant is yours.
I mentioned it to Superintendent Kitchell. Getting
some slaughtered tubercular cattle from Illinois is
Kitchell's idea. He wired or wrote, or both, from
his office and this is the result. Somebody inside,
sure&mdash;somebody for them and somebody for you&mdash;who
is it, Hiram?" I ended by demanding of him to
speak only the truth.</p>

<p>"I haven't mentioned one word to a soul other
than you," he stoutly insisted, his face as open
as a printed page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you mentioned your boat scheme to any
one?" I asked, fearful of the incaution of youth.</p>

<p>"Not a person knows of it from me but you and
Captain Marianna, and he doesn't know much yet.
But this is absolute evidence our finger is on the
right spot," he observed shrewdly, then added, less
confidently&mdash;"they must have some organization."</p>

<p>"Go ahead, Hiram, I still think your boat scheme
a very good one, but be very discreet and see if you
can think of any one who would send these notes
to you," I added darkly, much puzzled and annoyed.</p>

<p>"He is building and must have lumber&mdash;he'll fall
for some cheap stuff and the river is full of logs&mdash;and
it's perfectly feasible to saw them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe so, Hiram&mdash;provided he doesn't keep on
knowing what we have for breakfast. I will learn
more in a day or two&mdash;go ahead as fast as you can
about getting ready, but again I ask you to have an
interrogation point in front of you all the time."</p>

<p>"Ben"&mdash;he began, walking about the room
nervously, as though he felt his soul in danger&mdash;righteously
angered, but as one who showed real bigness&mdash;"I
am convinced that they have power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>enough, so that when they get ready they can for
a time make me the goat. I was in sole charge of
that wharf when the big thefts were pulled off;
what would be easier than to link me up with some
poor teamster and send the two of us to slaughter,
and even by arrest plant an imputation that could
be cited against me all my life? I could take this
Becker and tear his purple tallow person into bits
with my bare hands and throw the pieces into his
own rendering tanks with pleasure!" he shouted,
and he looked as though he could do it.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hiram, that possibility is present, but perhaps
you magnify it." Then believing his efficiency
would be augmented by a little less fear, I
told him, for the first time, that the provision market
was flooded with spurious goods bearing a genuine
government stamp as having been inspected and
passed, and that on this night I was going with a
Federal party in a move against Becker for that.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Locate him as soon as he leaves his New Orleans
office, then a safe expert, employed by the
government in alien-enemy work, will open his safe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>for evidence, and possibly will find the stolen seals,
stamps, and ink of the Department of Animal Industry."</p>

<p>"I have figured the case in just that way and supposed
you had, and that is why we must get inside
his plant. Opening his safe may help&mdash;finding the
seals don't prove the larceny&mdash;suppose they should
secrete those seals about the wharf, or worse still,
put them inside, or under my desk, in the wharf
office, what chance would I have to escape the implication?"
he asked, still walking about the room
looking at the floor.</p>

<p>"A dog having the bone will not prove he stole
the ham," I suggested.</p>

<p>"But that won't save the dog's ribs when he's
found with it," he retorted, relaxing.</p>

<p>"It is true, Hiram, their organization must begin
in Kansas City&mdash;and is pretty well oiled&mdash;but perhaps
not as efficient as you imagine; crooks always
forget something with a certainty that suggests
fatality."</p>

<p>"Let us hope so. But these notes&mdash;what makes
you think they are from a woman?" He stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>and looked squarely at me. "I don't like it," he
finished with a snap of his jaws.</p>

<p>"My reason just now is scarcely more than an
impression, hardly more than 'because,'" I replied.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night at dinner I asked Hiram how much
he knew about gasoline engines, and he looked up at
me sharply.</p>

<p>"Not very much; very little, in fact. The Gold-Beater
gave me a car once&mdash;a pretty good one&mdash;and
I was learning about motors fairly fast when
something happened. I knew motors needed water,
oil and gasoline, and that when I did certain things
it went, and sometimes it moved pretty fast. That
was the trouble&mdash;I met a bigger car and we both
went over in a man's front yard. I lost two wheels
and other things&mdash;I never saw it again. The Gold-Beater
and the insurance company settled somehow.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he continued after a pause, "I
don't blame the Gold-Beater much&mdash;two thousand
was my share for putting an innocent pedestrian
in the park on the bad side&mdash;I wonder he didn't get
the marble heart sooner." As he said this his lips
curled with self-criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>"How soon will you have the motor ready to
start? I am going to be very busy to-morrow. Can
you and the captain manage to start it alone?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow at noon we will have everything
ready for a try-out and if I don't feel safe we will
not attempt to start without you. Don't want to
take any chances; there's too much at stake," he insisted
with rare judgment.</p>

<p>"Everything is fair in love and war," is the libertine's
comfort in the case of a love contest&mdash;and in
war it depends on the kind of an enemy we have.
In this war any means of obtaining evidence against
our enemy was justified. That was my firm belief.
That night Becker &amp; Co.'s office was entered as
planned and his safe opened. While there was
plenty of evidence that he was trading illicitly and
with the enemy, I was disappointed in finding no
evidence of his thieving propensity, except a letter
he had received that day from the captain of a
Swedish ship, <em>Sparticide</em>, then in port, who in poor
English explained that he had "received the sample
and thought it would do, though the price was altogether
too high. If he would pack in half barrels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>and deliver as suggested, he would take the lot
for cash, delivered alongside."</p>

<p>This letter was carefully copied and replaced.</p>

<p>When I reached home just before daylight,
Hiram, Jr., was fast asleep, but when I awakened
later in the day he had gone.</p>

<p>I spent the greater part of the morning getting
the five bales of waste paper that had been unloaded
from Becker's boat on the steamship docks, into a
private fireproof room in the storage warehouse
where we had our barrel of "steel filings" stored,
and secured an affidavit from the steamship company
that they were received from Becker &amp; Co.</p>

<p>When I found leisure to examine them, I drew
samples from each bale and carefully estimated the
number, finding they checked up with the amount
of filled sausage cartons stolen from the car.</p>

<p>Before leaving the warehouse I had our barrel
put into the same room and secured it with a special
Government padlock. Recent correspondence had
developed that it contained a very rare German aniline
dye, which American manufacturers had as
yet been unable to produce, and offers for it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>risen to such a fabulous sum I was afraid to tell
Hiram about it for the present.</p>

<p>When I reached my office, my clerk, Miss Bascom,
was out to luncheon, but I had not been there
long before Superintendent Kitchell came in and
formally introduced Mr. Hiram Strong, Sr., whom
he had mentioned as being in transit over the system
in his private car, and asked me to extend any possible
courtesy, after which he bowed himself out
obsequiously.</p>

<p>I knew I was in the presence of a man. He was
tall and his full chest and very broad shoulders impressed
me as they had impressed Hiram. His hair
was iron gray and his very hat seemed to be made
to order for him. His eyes appeared to penetrate
without effort the object on which they turned,
and one knew instinctively that he could and would
note any discrepancy between what a person thought
and what he uttered.</p>

<p>I saw at once how Hiram, Jr., had come by his
nose piece, also his fine, clear skin and chiseled
mouth.</p>

<p>Superintendent Kitchell, contrary to his boast,
had told him all he knew about Hiram, Jr. He did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>not seem to want to hear more from me, but did
want some information about getting down the
river to the Hunting Club, where he was going to
shoot ducks.</p>

<p>"I left New York supposing I could dispense with
my secretary for a few weeks anyhow, but in that
I am disappointed. Would it be too much trouble
to obtain a stenographer to write some letters for
me?"</p>

<p>Hiram Strong, Sr., like his son, was one to whom
anything within reason could not be refused.</p>

<p>"Such talent is very scarce in New Orleans now,
but if you can manage with my clerk, Miss Bascom,
who is fairly efficient, you are welcome to her services&mdash;if
she does not object," was the only thing I
could say.</p>

<p>"I think she will do; in fact, almost any one," he
assured me.</p>

<p>But somehow I felt that I was doing the wrong
thing, for it suddenly occurred to me that Miss Bascom's
attitude or position was so clouded and mysterious
that, until I knew more, I should not trust
her with anything important. But Hiram Strong,
Sr., was not a man to be refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span></p>

<p>When Miss Bascom came in I introduced her
and was about to explain what was wanted, when
I stopped in amazement. The moment I mentioned
the name "Mr. Strong" her face became white as
marble, she raised her hand as though to advance
and greet him, but it fell and she stood as though
petrified, while I explained what he desired.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I hope I will be able to serve you," she managed
to say, while she gazed fixedly at him. I could
not guess whether it was fear or other excitement.</p>

<p>"My work is simple correspondence, and I am
sure you will be able to manage it," he replied assuringly,
and I was not certain whether he was admiring
her quail-like figure and unusually pretty
face, or, like myself, was trying to divine the unusual
excitement under the light bronze hair.</p>

<p>"I will do my best," she managed to say, beginning
to edge away toward her desk by the window.</p>

<p>"Would it be asking too much for you to come
out to the car? It is just under the train shed."</p>

<p>"Not at all, with Mr. Taylor's permission," she
replied quickly, in a more natural tone. I nodded
approval without looking at her, but did not relax
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>my endeavor to see if Hiram Strong, Sr., had missed
anything and decided he had not. He was not of
that sort.</p>

<p>She went to her desk, obtained notebook and pencils,
and stood expectantly looking out of the window
as though steeling herself for an ordeal.</p>

<p>"I will undoubtedly see you again before I go,
Mr. Taylor&mdash;I hope I will not greatly inconvenience
you by taking away your clerk," he added suavely,
going to the door and opening it as a sign for her to
go with him.</p>

<p>"Anything more I can do for you will be a pleasure,
Mr. Strong," I said, meeting his eye and getting
a full message from him.</p>

<p>After they were gone I remained at my desk endeavoring
to reach a logical conclusion as to the
attitude of this girl, who, at that moment, I was
ready to pronounce "infernal," probably because
she had so far baffled me. It is true I had not given
her any serious attention; perhaps I should have
done so. I reviewed in my mind her traffic with
Becker and the chief clerk, Burrell, and the fact
that I was quite positive she was the author of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>anonymous notes to Hiram. I decided to put a rod
in pickle for her, at once.</p>

<p>I asked that her movements be accounted for
every hour, and something positive be dug up concerning
her antecedents, as soon as I reached the
Department office, which precaution was rewarded
sooner than expected.</p>

<p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent in securing
an auxiliary gasoline tank and an air-compressor,
which Hiram, Jr., had said he must have
to complete his running outfit.</p>

<p>"Old man," he began, as soon as he came in that
evening, looking as dirty and disreputable as a longshoreman,
"we have a dandy outfit&mdash;the captain says
we can run away from anything. You've got the
tank and air-pump? Fine, old man, we will soon
kill off Becker and the whole crowd. All we need
now is that saw-mill in the 'Dead Hoss' warehouse,
and we are ready." He finished with great enthusiasm,
stripping his upper body for a complete clean-up
before eating dinner.</p>

<p>"Did you start the engine, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"No, but we are all ready. The captain wanted
to, but I thought we'd better wait for you. You've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>got to go out there the first thing in the morning,&mdash;you
can do that, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, maybe&mdash;but don't you think we had better
give it a pretty good try-out before we put anything
more into her?&mdash;she might prove a flivver."</p>

<p>"Never on your life&mdash;she's going to run like a
wolf&mdash;but maybe you are right about giving her a
good trial&mdash;suppose we bring her around into the
river?&mdash;that ought to be trial enough," he concluded,
coming close and displaying a wonderfully well developed
torso that with age would be as broad as his
father's, which I had been admiring but a short
time before. For a moment I speculated on how
he would feel if he knew that his father was in New
Orleans at that moment and that I had been talking
with him.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Ben; you seem to be dreaming. Did
you hear what I said?" he insisted, making me dodge
to escape a whack on the back.</p>

<p>"I believe you said it was over two hundred miles
through Ponchertrain around into the river?"</p>

<p>"Yes, over two hundred miles by water, but by
land, right through the city, only about a mile. But
we've got to get into the river."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, if she will go two hundred miles she will
go any distance."</p>

<p>"All right; I'm going to pack up to-night and
move aboard to stay until Becker and his crew are
all in limbo headed for the penitentiary&mdash;do you
hear me, Ben?"</p>

<p>I heard what he said, but was lost in considering
plans which at that moment required radical change,
and must be done with tact and judgment.</p>

<p>Hiram became thoughtful and remained so
throughout dinner, and as soon as we returned he
began, without further comment, to get his belongings
together and ready for transfer to the <em>Fearsome</em>,
fully convinced that his abode there would
last for a long time.</p>

<p>I remained in the attitude of the "immortal," who
waited for something to turn up, and I did not have
long to wait.</p>

<p>A messenger came with two rather startling bits
of information; the <em>Sparticide</em>, the Swedish ship,
had asked for her papers and wanted to clear at
five the next morning, and the more mystifying
knowledge&mdash;even to me&mdash;that my clerk, Miss Bascom,
had arrived at that moment at the St. Charles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>hotel and was dining there with a distinguished
stranger. Would I also check up the stranger?</p>

<p>Both situations needed immediate attention and I
could not be in two places at the same time. I called
Hiram, Jr., from the room where he was busily
packing.</p>

<p>"Hiram, come here and sit down long enough for
me to funnel a bit of instruction into your think
tank," said I, recalling that I had not mentioned
the <em>Sparticide</em> matter to him.</p>

<p>He came and sat down in front of me, the corners
of his mouth slightly elevated, folded his
hands in front of him and waited in a slightly
humorous and bored attitude for some inkling of
what he was about to draw.</p>

<p>"Hiram, a Swedish ship, bound for Stockholm,
is in the stream on the other side, just below Algiers,
and is asking to be cleared to-morrow morning
at five. It is thought she has, or will have to-night,
a considerable quantity of Becker &amp; Co.'s
product on board. Foodstuffs of any sort to Sweden
are forbidden, and if taken are contraband. His
clearance papers are blocked until we are satisfied.
Principally, what we want now is a liberal sample
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>of what they take aboard from Becker. You will
be there in an unofficial capacity, so use discretion,
but get the samples. Here is a copy of the captain's
letter closing the deal."</p>

<p>I had not half finished when his eyes began to
glitter and dance as though they might jump from
their sockets, and I had barely completed my instructions
when he grabbed the letter, threw on his
coat and bounded down the stairs three steps at a
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> who say that any man will naturally fall
for a pretty young woman are pessimistic. Age,
unspoiled, will crave association with youth, but
a young man will quite adequately fill the bill.</p>

<p>When I reached the hotel I had no trouble in
finding Hiram Strong, Sr., the Gold-Beater, in a
forest of millinery and subdued lights of the hotel
dining-room. He was the most prominent figure
in the big room, and sitting opposite him was my
clerk, Miss Bascom.</p>

<p>He was not a victim or an intended one&mdash;a lion
who, with playful stroke, could crush the beautiful
flower in front of him. His lids would narrow
occasionally with intense interest or curiosity. I
could not get close enough to hear what was said,
but she was quite voluble. I had no immediate interest
in him; he was fully able to care for himself,
but my interest in her was intensified. It seemed to
me that I could see on her beautiful shoulders, now
bared in dinner garb, the mark of the huge, pudgy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>filthy hand of Becker, in gross caress. The brand
of suspicion was upon her the moment she had
come into contact with him, when he pressed her to
his vile self, and her lips were violated by contact
with his lumpy, purple, filthy mouth as he kissed
her. Could her ears ever be maidenly again after
listening to his vile proposals?</p>

<p>I was not at all sure of her relations with Chief
Clerk Burrell, but I felt sure there was an understanding;
nor could I account for her anonymous
notes to Hiram, Jr. But here she sat comfortably
dining with his father after six or eight hours' acquaintance,
all of which was most disconcerting.</p>

<p>Truly a remarkable young woman, whatever her
impelling motive, was my thought. I felt that the
time was fast approaching when I could compel her
to hold up her last page for me to read.</p>

<p>At a reasonable hour the Gold-Beater put her
into a cab and sent her home. I hurried back to
our rooms expecting to hear from Hiram, Jr. His
mission was most difficult and important&mdash;would he
be successful?</p>

<p>There was no mistaking his bounding step on the
stairs, some time after eleven, and I was not surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>when he grabbed my foot and dragged me
from the bed where I was dozing.</p>

<p>"Get up, Ben; I've got it&mdash;the Swede was a hard
nut to crack, but I made him open up&mdash;I've got a
whole barrel full downstairs.&mdash;It's the stuff we
want, all right&mdash;come on and see it!" he exclaimed,
greatly excited, but suppressing himself with discretion.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" I asked, barely awake.</p>

<p>"Of course, I'm sure&mdash;come on down and see it&mdash;I
wouldn't take his word for anything. I made
him open up before he lowered it into my boat. He
tried to play innocent&mdash;jockeyed for some time, but
I finally showed him the copy of his letter and flatly
told him, 'No sample, no sail, also jail and his ship
interned.' A half barrel of that stuff is heavy and
I had the devil of a time getting it out of the boat
onto the levee. Then I got hold of Billy Swope's
taxi&mdash;he's safe&mdash;I've known him about the docks
for a long time. Where are we going to put it at
this time of night? Come on&mdash;wake up&mdash;you act
as if you'd been taking dope," he hissed, coming
threateningly toward me, playful but intensely excited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>"As a matter of fact I was planning, Hiram&mdash;&mdash;Leave
it in the cab&mdash;go down and tell the driver
he is engaged for the night."</p>

<p>When Hiram came back to the room he saw me
taking two full-sized cartons from my drawer and
asked with great excitement, "Where did you get
them?"</p>

<p>"From those five bales of waste-paper you saw
come off of Becker's boat onto the S. P. wharf:
didn't I tell you about it?" I asked, knowing I had
not told him and that there was still a great deal
more I could not tell him for the present.</p>

<p>It took us a long time to locate the agent of the
packing-house. The time seemed interminable before
we could rout him out of bed to identify the
goods as those that were stolen, but as soon as he
knew what we wanted he was very much awake and
ready for all requirements.</p>

<p>He came out to the cab, drew a liberal sample
from the barrel setting on end beside the driver,
took it to the light, felt of it, tasted it raw, but before
pronouncing it solemnly and unqualifiedly
theirs, he cooked and tasted it. We then made him
accompany us down to his plant, unlock his cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>storage house and there we left the barrel in his
charge to preserve as evidence, after I had filled
a full carton for further use that night.</p>

<p>We then drove back to the rooms where I had
left Hiram to finish his preparations for going
aboard the <em>Fearsome</em>.</p>

<p>"By Heaven, one man now knows I didn't steal&mdash;and
the rest of them have got to know before we
get through," said Hiram, wringing my hand before
I left him in order to drive to Superintendent Kitchell's
residence and give him a bad half hour.</p>

<p>Mr. Kitchell grumbled at first, but when he
learned my mission he, too, was jubilant and unstinting
in his praise. I had exhibited the full carton
of sausage and told him as much as I thought
necessary.</p>

<p>"We can have warrants issued at once, can't we?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no, not yet&mdash;the most important work is
yet to be done. The evidence we now have would
only convict Becker &amp; Co. of receiving stolen property.
How they were able to replace the Government,
the railroad and the packer's seals on the car
must be answered before we prove larceny. Young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>Strong's idea of getting into their plant is the best,
and we are ready to try it."</p>

<p>"Of course, you know best&mdash;we want to stop it
for good and all by sending every one to the Pen.
Taylor, have you made up your mind as to whom it
is in our office that is working with them?" he inquired
guardedly, wrapping his bathrobe about his
shins.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;pretty sure&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, as I said, you know best&mdash;whatever you
say goes a hundred per cent with me now&mdash;what
do you want?" his bald spot taking on a deeper red.</p>

<p>"Discontinue my office and give out freely that
any further effort in the case has been abandoned
as a failure. Besides, the robberies have stopped
now. I am going with young Strong to try and get
into their plant, and hope to secure the rest of the
necessary evidence in that way."</p>

<p>"Good idea; I will do what you ask to-day."</p>

<p>"One thing more, Mr. Kitchell, it seems necessary,
in fact extremely important for me not to lose
sight of my clerk, Miss Bascom&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I understand&mdash;I can attend to that easily," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>assented, as I left him to spend the remainder of the
morning getting ready to board the <em>Fearsome</em>.</p>

<p>Hiram, Jr., was silent most of the time, but moved
with such energy and determination that the thought
of failure was terrifying. In fact, I began to feel
almost as though I was getting on thin ice.</p>

<p>So much depended on the new motor and many
other sailing details impossible to think of at the
time.</p>

<p>Captain Marianna only claimed to be a navigator,
but he displayed considerable knowledge about gasoline
motors. He had attended to the many details
and was waiting for us with a confidence that was
reassuring.</p>

<p>After breakfast aboard, we all took a hand in
starting the motor.</p>

<p>"It runs as though made for the job," exclaimed
Hiram, hardly able to contain himself. He had not
shaved for several days and with dirty working
clothes he looked indeed a longshoreman, but was
oblivious to the fact.</p>

<p>When the motor had run long enough to get warm
I told him to throw in the clutch that started the
propeller, which he did without skill and so suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>that the <em>Fearsome</em> took up the slack of her
lines and before I could stop the motor or get to the
clutch she snapped them and was free from the
wharf.</p>

<p>Hiram realized he had blundered from inexperience
and his face flushed.</p>

<p>"Ben, will that hold us up? It was a devil of a
thing for me to do," he said, catching my arm,
greatly alarmed.</p>

<p>"Captain, have you plenty of line aboard?" I
called.</p>

<p>"Yes, plenty," he assured.</p>

<p>"Let's give her a few turns and if she moves all
right we'll head for the entrance of the lake."</p>

<p>"I think we're safe in that," he replied, and
Hiram's look changed to one of confidence at once,
evidently concluding his first blunder was not fatal
to the enterprise in which his whole soul was
wrapped.</p>

<p>The captain took the wheel, while I gave the
motor half speed and Hiram stood in wonder,
watching as we moved swiftly up the canal, and
when clear of it I gave the motor full speed and the
captain without more ado squared away towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>Mississippi Sound, the gulf to New Orleans on the
river.</p>

<p>"She runs like a <em>greyhound</em>," Hiram said,
after watching her go at full speed for a short time.
"How fast is she running?" he asked, apparently
forgetting his first disappointment, and consumed
with a fierce satisfaction that his complete vindication
and success was at hand.</p>

<p>"Perhaps eight or ten knots," I replied evasively.
As a matter of fact we were going over twelve and
I had to stand over the new motor with oil can and
grease bucket, so I paid no more attention to him.</p>

<p>We got out into the sound before noon. It is
unwise to run a new motor too far without stopping,
so I advised that we make a port and appealed to
the captain.</p>

<p>"We can make Gulfport in a short time," he replied,
to which we all assented and he changed his
course. When we got there a most unlooked for
incident occurred.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Was</span> the Gold-Beater's luck going to attend his
very vigorous and now virile son? There is no
such thing as luck; follow the smoke of the so-called
"lucky" and we soon conclude that they earn what
they get by sheer force of intense action.</p>

<p>The captain had hardly reached the Gulfport dock
before he was approached to take on a cargo for
New Orleans. Lumber was piled everywhere, with
no bottoms to move it to New Orleans.</p>

<p>The captain referred them to Hiram, Jr., as the
owner. He talked with them, then the three of us
went below. We were bound for New Orleans;
could we take a cargo of lumber?</p>

<p>Hiram's eyes danced and glistened with the possibilities.</p>

<p>"Ben, you know about our power; and you, captain,
know how seaworthy she will be." He wisely
interrogated both of us at the same time, looking
from one to the other.</p>

<p>"What do you think about the power, Ben?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span></p>

<p>"I think she will handle a load," I replied vaguely,
and added, "for a thrown-together, patched-up affair,
she performs wonderfully."</p>

<p>Hiram looked at Captain Marianna, as a man
born to lead. He wanted that officer's opinion.</p>

<p>"Well," hesitated the captain, "I believe she
is seaworthy and if you can get a load of timber we
can fill the hold and even take a deck load. Timber
loads and discharges quickly. Our course, nearly all
the way is protected, and if a blow comes we can
easily find shelter," he concluded with suppressed
eagerness.</p>

<p>"That's all right, but how about time? I don't
want to lose a lot of time. We didn't start in to
carry freight," said Hiram with determination.</p>

<p>"Go and see how soon they can load and be careful
to settle the freight rate," suggested the captain.
Hiram sprang to the deck. His mind seemed to be
working like a trip hammer.</p>

<p>"Ben, can they do that?" he asked excitedly when
he returned; but before I could reply he continued:
"do you know, they threatened to commandeer our
craft if we don't take timber to New Orleans. It's
for Government work&mdash;can they do that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, they can."</p>

<p>"And they say we have nothing to say about the
freight rate&mdash;that is fixed," he said, his eyes wide
and keen with wonder at the new situation into
which he had so suddenly plunged.</p>

<p>"The freight rate will no doubt be liberal
enough," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Then we might just as well get the credit of
doing it willingly," he wisely concluded, and was
away again.</p>

<p>In less than half an hour we moved up about a
thousand feet, and all the men available were busy
crowding timber into the <em>Fearsome</em>, continuing the
work far into the night. The captain looked after
the stowage and I was busy getting an emergency
supply of gasoline, oil and sundry necessary supplies.
Hiram provisioned and attended to other
details. He was in an element natural to him and
seemed to forget everything else. By daylight the
next morning we had the hold full and a deck-load
six feet high. In fact, the <em>Fearsome</em> looked like a
floating, sawed timber raft, bound and tied together
with log chains.</p>

<p>After breakfast as we were feeling our way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>out of the river into the sound, Hiram came down
very soberly to where I was attending to the engine.
He was evidently well pleased. Hands that but a
short while ago were manicured twice a week were
now broadened, manly, brown and grease-stained.</p>

<p>"Don't you think we are short-handed?" he asked.
"I tried to get some one but couldn't. I hate to have
you stand by that motor long hours at a time. Perhaps
I can help?"</p>

<p>"If the weather is good we ought to make the
mouth of the river by night, anchor there, get some
sleep and complete the journey to New Orleans to-morrow
in daylight."</p>

<p>"Ben! do you mean to say we can make New
Orleans in two days?" he asked in open-eyed wonder.</p>

<p>"If we don't get bad weather."</p>

<p>"Say, do you think I am awake&mdash;pinch me&mdash;take
something and hit me on the head to be sure I am
not astraddle a 'Night-Hoss,'" he suggested, pulling
himself up on the head of one of the galvanized
barrels of emergency gasoline near me, holding his
head between his hands to keep his nerves from running
away with him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>I looked at him and smiled but did not reply.</p>

<p>"Do you know we have two thousand dollars'
worth of freight here, and you say we can get into
New Orleans in two days? I must be dreaming."</p>

<p>"But have you figured all the expenses&mdash;bar
pilotage&mdash;river pilotage, dockage and everything?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not all&mdash;but it can't possibly be five hundred
dollars; and we can make the round trip in a week.
Fifteen hundred dollars a week, Ben; and they say
they have enough timber to be moved to keep us
going for a year! Ben, I'm dreaming&mdash;a coke-eater's
dream&mdash;and if it wasn't for that infernal
Becker matter, how we could clean up!" He
charged about savagely as though he had drunk
mixed liquor and cocaine.</p>

<p>"You were up all last night; better get some
sleep," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Yes, I haven't had a real night's sleep for a long
time," he added, with a note of sadness, "and I
don't want any yet."</p>

<p>Elated with success, the Becker matter was emphasized
as a knife in his heart, and it was keeping
him away from Anna Bell Morgan. Success has a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>way of trying men's hearts in the most unexpected
manner.</p>

<p>We made the river as calculated and on the second
morning were fast to the dock and the much
needed timber going off as fast as it went on. Although
busy and most of the time reticent, Hiram,
Jr., never failed to call my attention to the numerous
logs and floating trees in the river, which he
insisted would make good lumber, and just for the
taking. I hurried to our rooms as soon as possible
to get my mail.</p>

<p>There I found several notes of different dates
from a man from New York then in New Orleans
and waiting to see me about something very important.
Entirely in the dark as to what he wanted, I
arranged by telephone and met him at once at the
Monteleon Hotel. I was disgusted. Great effort,
loss of sleep and singleness of purpose to help
Hiram, by cleaning up the case, made the business
world appear as the full glare of a searchlight to
eyes accustomed to thick darkness. It was about the
barrel&mdash;he said he had come down from New York
about it and exhibited one of the samples I had sent
there. Bluntly, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>"We want the stuff and want you to put a price
on it."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to be bothered about that stuff
now." The fellow's lack of tact half angered me;
his nervous eagerness undoubtedly whetted by his
days of waiting for me did not fit in with my mood.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we need that color badly on Government
fabric orders and if you refuse to put a price on it
we may have to find another way," he said, with
deliberation which, engrossed as I was, insulted me.
His New England drawl grated on me somehow.</p>

<p>"Oh, if that is all you want, I'll name a price&mdash;you
can have it for a hundred dollars a pound," I
said, rising. I knew I was needed back on the <em>Fearsome</em>
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>"Do you know that the pre-war price of that color
was about seventy-five cents?" he quietly asked me.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the pre-war price was, but
that is our price now," I said, walking away
abruptly. I felt that I had much more important
matters to consider then, and hurried down to the
wharf where I supposed the <em>Fearsome</em> was being
speedily unloaded.</p>

<p>Before I got within a thousand feet of where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span><em>Fearsome</em> was I knew something was wrong. The
boat was gone; Hiram Strong, Jr., sat on the end
of a pile holding his head between both hands, and
as I came still nearer I noted there was between
Hiram's hands and head a paper folded like a legal
document.</p>

<p>I had lately found myself wondering how Hiram,
Jr., would behave when Dame Fortune landed her
knuckles between his eyes with a staggering blow.
I knew it had to come. I had become so attached
to him that I dreaded it as one dreads to see a lovable
child punished, though to its manifest advantage.</p>

<p>He did not say a word or move until I came up
to him. There was something of a sneer and a contemptuous
curl in his face when I looked the question
I hesitated to ask. He sneered openly at the
Jinx that had come to harass him.</p>

<p>"Well, Ben, I guess we have made the fatal mistake
of underestimating the resources of our enemies&mdash;they've
got us."</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Hiram</span> still retained his nerve, but his anger and
disappointment had become stolid as he handed me
the paper and pointed to the <em>Fearsome</em> across the
river&mdash;the tug still alongside.</p>

<p>I stood before him, astonished and silent, hastily
examining the paper. It was an injunction the
court had issued, restraining him from interfering
with the lawful owners of the boat <em>Fearsome</em>, of
which he had obtained possession by an irregular
and fraudulent sale.</p>

<p>"The officer has just left," Hiram volunteered.
"The captain and I were on the dock checking up
when the tug came alongside. I thought nothing
until they slipped our lines and she was away before
I could walk twenty feet," he said, letting his
foot drop to the dock despondently.</p>

<p>"Ben, I thought we had a right&mdash;she was sold for
crew's wages. We had nothing to do with that.
We only bid her in," he began, but with no note of
censure, although I had attended to that detail.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>
<p>"We have to know that."</p>

<p>"And has any one the right to take her&mdash;isn't that
stealing?" he asked, suppressing his fierceness.</p>

<p>"They have her now in their possession and you
are enjoined by the court from interfering," I said,
half to myself, trying to think if I had heard of any
hint of this procedure.</p>

<p>"Ben, do you suppose it is the Becker crowd&mdash;have
they got wind of our plan, and are they doing
this?" he asked, with wonderful self-possession.</p>

<p>"It may be, Hiram, but I doubt it&mdash;I am afraid
the owners have shown up and are trying to regain
their property in this way, alleging an irregular sale.
They had to make some such showing to get the injunction."</p>

<p>"What can we do?" he snapped at me, as though
becoming incensed at my deliberation.</p>

<p>"My boy&mdash;when passing amid rocks the captain
must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Ben&mdash;you can understand,"
he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Whether they are right or wrong to fight the
courts means months' and perhaps years' delay&mdash;the
only thing possible is to compromise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>"We must eat out of their hand Ben?" he
started to heat up anew. We were so intent that
we did not notice the approach of a quiet, middle-aged
man who asked very politely for "Mr. Strong."</p>

<p>"Mr. Strong, I come from the office of the plaintiffs'
attorneys. They have decided that they do
not wish to interfere with the unloading of freight
for the Government, and we will bring the <em>Fearsome</em>
alongside and let the cargo be discharged, provided
you or the captain do not go aboard her&mdash;that is,
not to attempt to dispute our possession."</p>

<p>"I was wondering how they were going to get
away with that," Hiram jerked out impulsively.</p>

<p>"No, sir&mdash;we don't want to interfere that way&mdash;and
more, Mr. Strong, I am to say that if you will
come to our office possibly something can be arranged."</p>

<p>Then it was that impulsive youth and inexperience
burst out, and while I was glad to hear him
say it, I knew it was indiscreet. It was perhaps
just what the Gold-Beater would have said at his
age, and, in his present power, likely to do so now:</p>

<p>"You can tell the attorneys for the plaintiffs to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>to hell," he said, springing to his feet. "This is plain
stealing and there's a penitentiary for them. No&mdash;we
won't go aboard; that timber must come ashore,"
and he posted off to get the crew of longshoremen
to work at unloading again.</p>

<p>The quiet, polite man from the attorneys' office
remarked to me: "The young man shows considerable
mettle. If you are interested you had better
come down to the office," handing me the firm's
card and departing.</p>

<p>In another half-hour the <em>Fearsome</em> was in full
mourning, black longshoremen swarming over it
and the edge of the dock, but the tug remained
lashed alongside. The long timber, sawed ten by
ten and twelve by twelve, seemed to have some
means of locomotion as though anxious to get on
the wharf. I could see Hiram had a way of getting
things done.</p>

<p>During this time I sat on the end of the pile
where I had found him and watched the operation,
thinking that my job was getting rather strenuous.
I was as completely in the dark as to this last move
as was Hiram.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>Presently he came over to me. He had evidently
been both working and thinking hard.</p>

<p>"Say, do you still think this move is made by
the owners to get value for their property, or is it
a rascally deal to block us?" he asked doggedly.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;it may be one or the other, or
even both&mdash;anyhow it's our next move."</p>

<p>Hiram rubbed his stubbly chin with one hand and
then the other, and looked at the <em>Fearsome</em> as though
in some way it had become a part of him.</p>

<p>"Somehow I feel it is the owners&mdash;perhaps this
is the only way they could proceed&mdash;of course, she
is worth twenty times what we paid&mdash;if it is, they
ought to be reasonable. The <em>Fearsome</em> lying out
there rotting, without power, and the <em>Fearsome</em> with
power and at work, is very different, but they may
rightfully expect more than the crew's back wages."</p>

<p>I nodded assent, wondering where his line of reasoning
would lead.</p>

<p>"Now it may be only money they want&mdash;as soon
as this load is out of her we can collect two thousand
freight&mdash;and, Ben&mdash;you&mdash;you have not said anything
lately about that barrel&mdash;is it possible to sell
that now? Whatever it will bring will come in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>handy to get time enough to pay this claim&mdash;there's
lots of timber up there and they want it moved.
If we can get enough help I believe we can make
two trips a week instead of one. Three thousand
a week will soon wipe them out&mdash;and sooner or
later we've got to pay the railroad for that motor."</p>

<p>"But, Hiram, what about Becker &amp; Co.? We
started out to get into their place and we must not
lose sight of that now."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know&mdash;but if these men mean to be
fair they must allow us time. Ben, you are a better
diplomat; go down and see these attorneys."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go at once&mdash;also I'll see what I
can do with the barrel of <em>steel filings</em>," I said, rising
with a smile, and digging him in the ribs jokingly&mdash;he
was in good humor now. But it occurred to me
that in my shabby treatment of the prospective buyer
I had been as indiscreet as Hiram when he invited
the attorneys to brimstone land, whereas they
possibly meant well enough.</p>

<p>Hiram did not smile, but I was sure he felt a
little relieved at my attitude when I left, intending
to hunt up my caller from New York, who emphasized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>the first syllable of Bos'ton as though born to
the manner of speech used in that great eastern port.</p>

<p>On my way back to the rooms to clean up a bit,
I decided to see the attorneys first, and was considerably
irritated to find the man after our barrel
standing at the foot of my stairs, waiting sentry-like
for me as though I had committed a crime.
Something about the undersized fellow aggravated
me, though I knew I had great need of him now.
The impulse was strong upon me to put my foot
on his stomach and shove him across the street into
a curio shop. I was sure he wanted that barrel of
color, but I didn't like his face. If I didn't sell it
to him I could elsewhere, so I was obdurate. One
hundred dollars per pound, cash, current funds in
hand, take it or leave it, but say so quick, was all
he could get out of me, as I kept thinking all the
time of the necessity of washing up and getting
over to see the attorneys.</p>

<p>He finally took me to his bankers, who told me
his credit was practically unlimited with them, then
he said he would take it on my terms. We went
to the warehouse, got the barrel and weighed it carefully.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>He even paid me for the odd ounces and it
was not until we went back to the bank and the
money was actually in my possession, that I realized
the size of the transaction. He then told me it
was a very rare color and that only a small amount
was required for blending, which was the reason
they could pay so much.</p>

<p>It took most of the day, but I did have time to
go to the attorney's office, and begin more jockeying
for position. I soon learned they wanted money, not
the boat, were even willing to take it on the <em>excitement</em>
plan, as Hiram suggested. It was worth more
but they would take twenty thousand dollars. I
thought they were distinctly disappointed when I offered
cash.</p>

<p>I obtained some allowance for what we paid at
the sale. I then returned to the rooms with a bill
of sale for the vessel, knowing it would not be
long before Hiram would come. I felt disposed to
laugh. Some one's plans had miscarried.</p>

<p>I heard his step on the first stair. He came up
this time one step at a time, as though carrying
weights on each foot, and when he came in I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>he was tired and hungry, but mystified and still
fighting.</p>

<p>He came by way of his room, through the communicating
door, into my room, where I was busy
looking over a considerable mail, placed a chair back
toward me, sat down on it reverse way, resting his
arms on the back, let fall his big unshaven chin
and looked from under the visor of his cap like a
young lion ready to spring.</p>

<p>"Ben, you old dog, what have you been doing?"
quick to gather assurance from my attitude. "Just
before I left the dock the tug and all the men left,
saying they were through so far as they knew."</p>

<p>"Yes, the <em>Fearsome</em> is released, and all claims
against it settled."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;but how did you do it?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Somehow at that moment it occurred to me that
it might be best to tell the whole incredible story
of the sale of the barrel of color which had been a
standing joke between us. It was one of those
extremely rare things that could happen only in war
times, and I thought the flog of resistance better for
him than the stimulant of easy success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I induced them to cut their claim down
some&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," he interrupted; "get to the point&mdash;how
did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Well," I began again, "this morning I was too
busy to tell you that a man came all the way from
New York to buy our barrel of steel filings,&mdash;he's
been waiting about all the time we have been gone
on our trip&mdash;when I got through with him I had
enough money to release the <em>Fearsome</em> and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben," he interrupted, his eyes glittering, "you
are an infernal&mdash;no, I won't say liar, because I don't
believe you would lie&mdash;but you are romancing now
to make me feel good, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, then, have it your way&mdash;all you need
to know is that the <em>Fearsome</em> is released and you
are free to do with her as you like&mdash;but just now I
advise a shave for you and some stimulating food&mdash;for
instance a beefsteak as big as&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben, it's got to be as big as the state of New
Hampshire this time and as thick as the crust of
the earth&mdash;&mdash;" He interrupted himself by springing
over the chair, as I thought to thump me on the
back, but instead he grabbed my hand affectionately.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>He craved relief from a long strain; my information
took effect upon him like the champagne he
used to take, and at that moment refused to consider
what it cost or its ultimate effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> both cleaned up a bit and went out to dinner.
I found he had done a good deal of planning. He
knew what he wanted but did not know exactly how
to get it. He was firm in the plan of getting the saw-mill
we had seen in the unclaimed freight house
onto the deck of the <em>Fearsome</em> and going up the
river for the double purpose of making lumber from
the "floaters," but most of all to have an excuse for
getting into Becker &amp; Co.'s plant. He was very
sober most of the time, even morose, but occasionally
his youthful buoyancy and humor would break
out in the most surprising and delightful way.</p>

<p>We canvassed the details of using the motor to
run the saw, and decided that we would try it the
next day.</p>

<p>"But, Hiram, suppose the timber people insist on
your going back for another load? They can force
you."</p>

<p>"They know, or think, we are still tied up with
litigation. Besides&mdash;can't you explain to some one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>&mdash;a few days will turn the trick," he reasoned.
"After we get Becker we may want to see them as
badly as they want to see us," he added, with an eye
for the main chance.</p>

<p>"Hiram, have you seen or heard from Anna Bell
Morgan?" I asked suddenly to surprise him.</p>

<p>"No, I haven't&mdash;but as the time approaches&mdash;and
you know it is coming&mdash;when I can go back to her
with clean hands, I feel as though I can hardly
contain myself. That's what keeps me up and
doing; of course, I want to make out the Gold-Beater
as a damned poor prophet about my future, but
the main thing is her. Do you know, I actually feel
her beside me urging me on and making me do
things. It will be my happiest day when I can go
back to her clean&mdash;actually clean." While he spoke
he was digging away at the remnants of the great
steak he had consumed, and for the first time I saw
the harbingers of real manhood as he looked at me
through eyes unabashed and unashamed.</p>

<p>The next day was a very busy one. He collected
his freight and we moved the <em>Fearsome</em> to dock near
the unclaimed freight house. I arranged with
Superintendent Kitchell by telephone to take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>sawmill, and by night it was bolted to the deck, with
power from the motor applied. A derrick with outrigging,
so that a log could be grappled and brought
to the deck by power, and laid on the saw carriage
to be solidly locked down for its terrible shining
fangs that become invisible in full career, moving
through a dirty, slimy log.</p>

<p>"Yes," Superintendent Kitchell had said to me
when I asked him about my clerk, "I have taken
Miss Bascom into my private office and found work
for her there&mdash;perfectly safe any time you want
her," he assured me, after getting a brief account
of our progress.</p>

<p>At the first sign of daylight the next morning we
left the dock with our queer looking craft and started
up the river. Through an employment agency
Hiram had secured three additional men, a sawyer
and two laborers.</p>

<p>Hiram's interest amounted to intense excitement
when the first log was cut. He had waited until
he saw an unusually promising one go through. One
of the laborers rowed to it, fastened the grapples
and it seemed to want to come aboard, as though
tired of life in the river, and there it lay quietly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>without one flinch before the saw that passed
through it. The sawyer understood his business,
four slab cuts were made skillfully, the log squared
and finally reduced to wide, clean, inch boards and
stored below in less than ten minutes. Hiram found
it hard to contain himself. His intense joy and elation
threatened his dignity. He had made something
useful, valuable, beautiful, with the delicate
odor of the spring woods, from hitherto waste material.
I knew what would have happened had
we been alone. He would have tried to throw on
me his now brawny person and pummel me from
sheer exuberance.</p>

<p>"Ben," he said, in a tense undertone, "over five
hundred feet of lumber in that log that they will
mob us to get at five cents a foot." I knew he
wanted to cut a big caper and cavort. "Twenty-five
dollars, Ben, in less than ten minutes. Say,
if Becker don't fall for cheap lumber&mdash;well, we'll
get him sure with such bait, and the bayou back
of his place is full of logs&mdash;we won't be there an
hour before he comes for it&mdash;just you watch. We
can be there by to-morrow morning," he went on,
his eyes roaming the river on both sides for another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>good log that had eluded the lumber men in the long
reaches of the Mississippi as far back as the Great
Lakes.</p>

<p>That night we tied up at a bank across the river
and a little below Becker &amp; Co.'s plant. It had been
a busy day and every one except Hiram was tired
and glad to stop for supper. I was sitting aft smoking
when I noticed him come up from below, looking
for me.</p>

<p>"I've been down taking stock and checking
up the day," he began, squatting down before me
on his heels, keeping his pipe in his mouth. "We
captured just thirty-nine logs, you know a few of
them had rotten centers, but we've got over twenty
thousand feet of clear lumber besides nearly three
thousand feet of culls. Figure it out at fifty
dollars&mdash;it's worth more delivered&mdash;eleven hundred
dollars&mdash;first day&mdash;all amateurs&mdash;we've got the big
idea working."</p>

<p>"Why do you say we, Hiram? I claim no credit
or interest or wages; I'm paid&mdash;it is your plan&mdash;don't
be so modest."</p>

<p>"Yes, I did get the idea of capturing this waste,
but how far would I have got alone&mdash;a hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>and twenty-five dollars per from the railroad and a
certainty of being accused of stealing. In a thousand
years I never will be charged with ingratitude&mdash;if
we win, you've got&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The weak spot, Hiram, is that you will soon
clean the river of logs, and then what? Sit still and
wait for the once-a-year highwater to bring them
down?" I asked, interrupting him purposely.</p>

<p>"Wait till we get Becker over there," he said,
suddenly sobering and looking across the river, but
making no other sign&mdash;something as a wolf looks
at his prey within easy reach. "It's a hundred and
fifty miles from here to the Gulf and lots of logs
all the way. But with our big job done, once get
actually free, and we run out of logs, something
will turn up; in fact I've got another idea hatching.
Do you see the foundation he has started over
there? That's why he must have lumber. Doesn't
his plant remind you of a quarantine station&mdash;or a
pest house?" He asked this question as though he
did not expect an answer.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning it occurred to me that, while
our plans were made with great care, the weak point
was, that if Becker himself was at the plant he
might recognize either of us. I mentioned this to
Hiram, and for once since I had met him he laughed
loud and long.</p>

<p>"I don't believe your mother would recognize you
in that greasy, dirt-soaked, bifurcated night dress
you wear," he yelled at me, "and the work you owe
the barber, too; but look at me&mdash;I am worse yet,
covered with mud and slime. Besides, I don't believe
Becker ever had a good look at me, and if he
did he couldn't pick me out as different from any
other deckhand now," he said, grinning. Then he
looked himself over, at his muddy shoes, browned
hands, long hair and unshaved face, and it did seem
to him as though, without effort, during the past
few days, he had prepared a genuine disguise.
Nevertheless we decided it would be safe to allow
Captain Marianna to be the spokesman, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>the captain should be kept in the dark concerning
our real designs. Marianna should sell Becker
lumber, cheap for cash, if he bit at our bait.</p>

<p>We sawed one or two logs, then crossed the river
and began working up the stream toward the bayou
back of Becker's plant, apparently with no more
interest in it than if it had been a cemetery. The
bayou was, just as Hiram said, full of logs&mdash;enough
to keep us there for a day at least.</p>

<p>By the noon hour we had worked pretty well into
the bayou and in back of the big fertilizer factory,
with no apparent attention from it other than a terrible
offense to our nostrils. If Becker was there
he did not show himself and it began to look as if
we would have to make overtures.</p>

<p>But when we had suspended operations for noon-time,
a negro with a boat made out from the Becker
place and came alongside. He clambered on our
deck, but no one paid any attention to him.</p>

<p>"I wants to see de boss," said he to one of our
blacks resting well aft.</p>

<p>"You wants to see de Captain? He's up dere
somewhares aroun' de wheel-house." We overheard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>this inquiry and the answer with great interest.
This was likely to be the first nibble at our bait.</p>

<p>When the captain was pointed out he acted well
the part of a trader who had desirable goods with
a liberal demand, but evidenced little interest in the
emissary who approached him hat in hand.</p>

<p>"Is you de cap'm?"</p>

<p>"Yes, me da capitan," Marianna replied, assuming
strong Italian accent without effort.</p>

<p>"Yas'sa&mdash;yas'sa," the darky echoed, looking
about the boat, wet, dirty and littered with bark,
slabs, and sawdust. "My boss, Mista Becka, wants
to know&mdash;would like to know," he corrected, "if
you kain't cum ashore to see him."</p>

<p>"Whata yo' boss want?&mdash;we start upa quick,
gotta not much time."</p>

<p>"Wal, he did'n zactly say, but I done reckon as
how he wants to see you 'bout somp'n pa'tic'lar."</p>

<p>"Go back, tella da boss we starta to work soon&mdash;I
talka with him here after we getta da start," the
captain said, pointing toward the deck.</p>

<p>"Yas, I'll tell him dat," replied the negro, fidgeting
as though his mission had been a failure, but
immediately started for his boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>"You tella heem we be here alla day; he come
any time," Marianna called to him as he rowed
away.</p>

<p>In about an hour the negro made out again, but
this time he had the bulky figure of the man we
wanted to see above all others. Of course, while we
were running I had to stand by the engine below
constantly, while Hiram, anticipating Becker's visit,
had taken to a boat ostensibly to look over the logs
carefully before fastening the grapples that brought
them aboard.</p>

<p>Becker had not been aboard long before it was
clear that Hiram had planned better than he knew.
There is something about a saw in full career that
the most blasé cannot resist. He stood watching it
for some time. A huge wet and mud-laden log
was hauled aboard, laid on the carriage, where steel
teeth clenched it down. In a twinkling four side
slabs came off and it was transformed into a square
timber, clean and white, in strange contrast to the
slimy thing it had been but a moment before. Then
the whirling teeth began to travel through it with
an ease that suggested a much softer material, laying
out inch boards which disappeared below.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>
<p>Captain Marianna brought him below to see the
stock on hand, and it seemed to fill the bill, but as
he was leaving our big motor attracted his attention.
Becker was not the debonaire Lothario he
affected to be when in New Orleans. Now sadly
unkempt, it seemed to me that his great midriff
exuded grease, but it might have been sweat.</p>

<p>He was greatly interested in learning how the
big motor, originally intended for an air-plane, not
only propelled a boat and ran a sawmill, but yanked
in the logs, and hauled in our rigging.</p>

<p>He finally came over to where I stood trying
my best to look bored and tired.</p>

<p>"Do you ever have any trouble with it?" he asked,
jerkily pointing a pudgy thumb toward the motor.</p>

<p>"No-o-o&mdash;but of course it's got to be watched."</p>

<p>"I've got one over there running an ice machine,
but I don't know whether its the nigger I've got
running it, or whether it's overloaded, or no good,
but it makes lots of trouble." I could see he wished
to get some free technical instruction.</p>

<p>"It's likely your man doesn't know all about it," I
led him on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>Our talk ended in my promise to go ashore that
night and take a look at it.</p>

<p>Yes, he wanted lumber and the captain's price
seemed satisfactory. In addition he wanted some
lumber sawed half an inch thick for crating&mdash;and
more&mdash;he would like to have all the sawdust we
could save for him. He needed it in some insulating
work on a cooler room&mdash;so he said.</p>

<p>That night we were to come alongside his wharf
and he would have his negroes unload during the
night what lumber we had so we would lose no time
next morning.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I've got lots of niggers to do it," he
explained when leaving.</p>

<p>When Hiram heard of the turn things had taken
he could hardly contain himself. He acted like a
man who had been in a dungeon for months and
suddenly caught a glimmer of light. As for myself,
I saw only that we were nearing the end of a very
unpleasant bit of investigation.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Hiram," I cautioned, "the least bad
move will spoil it. This man has a low cunning&mdash;hypnotize
yourself into thinking it is not of much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>importance and you have a year to do it. A show of
haste will be fatal."</p>

<p>Hiram was quick to see the point and began to
grin. I knew he was about ready to jump out of
his skin with excitement.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said he, "it is now only a little
after two and we have sawed more logs and made
more good lumber than we did all day yesterday!"
Evidently he was trying to control himself. "The
sawyer tells me he must have nice clear logs to
make half-inch lumber on Becker's order. I guess
I'll spend the afternoon picking them out."</p>

<p>It took longer than we thought to work our way
out of the bayou and up to Becker's floating wharf.
As soon as we were tied up he came down with a
lot of negroes, who began at once to unload the
lumber, carrying it piece by piece back near his
building operations. Captain Marianna checked it
as it left.</p>

<p>Now on the windward side of the plant it was
possible to eat. It was a long rambling building,
painted the color of a freight car, occasionally rising
to two stories; on one end were the posts driven
in the ground for a considerable addition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>After supper we sat smoking, well up on the
bank. It soon became evident that Becker did not
intend to lose a chance to get expert advice on his
gas-engine troubles. He waddled over to us with
some real Havanas and with little tact reminded me
of my promise.</p>

<p>Though the sun was low, Becker was still in his
working togs, bareheaded and stripped to an undershirt.
In this array he was a sight to behold, with
his sagging jowls, from which great billows of fat
formed rolls about his neck.</p>

<p>"This boy here is my assistant, Mr. Becker&mdash;he
has found engine trouble even when I couldn't," I
said, pointing toward Hiram, as we got up to go
with him.</p>

<p>How vitally interested Hiram was in this move
would be hard to estimate. Much more experienced,
I could only contain myself and be natural by refusing
to think of the tremendous importance of
our acting now, and, without coaching, I think
Hiram did the same thing. The slightest false move
would render worse than useless planning that had
consumed much time and large expenditure.</p>

<p>Hiram walked beside Becker as nonchalantly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>though strolling along Broadway, while I followed
slightly in the rear. Hiram's now wonderfully developed
physique seemed ready for action, ready to
break loose with overpowering ferocity. I watched
him furtively out of the corner of an eye to make
sure he did not precipitate an affair that would
"spill the beans."</p>

<p>Becker led us around the outside of the buildings&mdash;I
was sure there was a short cut through them&mdash;to
a lean-to shed containing the troublesome engine
now laboring with its burden as a locomotive
starting to move an overload.</p>

<p>"Ben, the engine is overcrowded," said Hiram, as
we stood by it, addressing himself to me just loud
enough for Becker to hear. Becker stood slightly
apart from me as though he had turned a patient
over to us for the time being. I was glad his big
black engineer was not there. My policy was never
to kill, but my duty was to get what I went after.</p>

<p>We spent ten minutes examining the details of
the engine, narrowly watched by Becker. Hiram's
conduct was wonderful. He acted as though there
was nothing under Heaven or on earth that interested
him so much as discovering how we could help
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>cure the sick motor. We asked to see the load on
the driving belt that disappeared from the driving
pulley through a board partition.</p>

<p>Becker, fairly assured, took us inside into a dark
space to a ten-ton ice machine, developing about
half its capacity because of slow speed.</p>

<p>Glancing about it for a moment, we returned to
the engine room and went outside as though about
to return to the dock, considering it a hopeless case.
Becker followed us, greatly concerned.</p>

<p>"Mr. Becker, it is a plain case of overload; you
must lighten the work of your ice machine. You
are attempting to make the motor do too much.
The engine might be helped a little by readjusting,
but that would not be enough," I said, with a sort
of hesitating finality, as we both edged away in the
direction we had come.</p>

<p>Becker followed and came close up beside us.</p>

<p>"How can I do that?&mdash;you see I am so far away
up here I can get no one to do such things," he
pleaded.</p>

<p>"The only way is to reduce the circulating distance
of the ammonia mixture, and then what you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>have left will cool more space than it does now," I
said, actually feeling sure that was the case.</p>

<p>"How can I do that?" he urged, noticing quickly
our inclination to leave.</p>

<p>"That might be very easy or it might be quite a
job. We could not tell without examining your
piping system," I replied as one who had done a
big day's work and was thinking more of sleep than
of his troubles, particularly since he had not offered
us anything to remedy. Becker had enough
sense to see this.</p>

<p>He screwed up his face in a way that brought
prodigious wrinkles upon his forehead. Then followed
an attempt to be patronizingly generous.</p>

<p>"Boys, I'll tell you what I'll do. I know you've
been working all day and are tired, but if you will
take time enough to look the whole system over
and help it some, I will give you five dollars apiece&mdash;I
must do something or I will have a lot of stuff
spoiled&mdash;in fact, I have had some spoil already,"
he ended half to himself.</p>

<p>Hiram glanced at me quickly, and Becker thought
that this swift movement to take down his pipe
was caused by the lure of his cash offer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> spent two hours examining the remotest part
of the refrigerating plant, piloted and aided at first
by Becker. As it grew darker he furnished us with
a torch. By this time we had made certain adjustments
to the engine, the necessity of which we had
noted on first inspection, and left it running merrily
away with its load like a horse relieved of a choking
collar. Becker saw this, gave five dollars to each
of us, and after the fashion of a boor, tried to appear
grateful. Then he paid cash for all the lumber
now stacked on the bank, with the understanding
we were to bring as much more, after which he left
us to go, as he thought, to our beds. But that was
not our plan; we had work ahead of too much importance
to think of sleep.</p>

<p>While we were making the examination of a large
part of Becker's plant, for that is what it amounted
to, Hiram controlled himself and behaved like a
veteran, but at times I think he shrewdly guessed
that I displayed more skill than an amateur. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>fact, I was so mightily interested in the outcome
that I made no attempt to disguise the fact that
under the guise of gasfitter, steamfitter, electrician,
or refrigeration expert, I had gained access to the
very bowels of buildings and manufacturing plants
for a similar purpose.</p>

<p>When Becker had gone Hiram presented a curious
combination&mdash;elation and disappointment. He
fairly trembled now with suppressed excitement. He
turned fiercely upon me and whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Ben, we got a lot, but not the most important.
We didn't find the seals, did we?" He asked this in
a suppressed tone, but not until he had gone forward
to make sure all the crew were on deck and
asleep. Captain Marianna was snoring loudly in
the pilot house.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but all those hams, dried meat&mdash;horse-meat&mdash;and
tubs of lard&mdash;renderings from dead animals&mdash;were
freshly stamped, 'Inspected and passed,'
with a Government stamp, and with Government
ink."</p>

<p>"But the stamps and seals we want, Ben." I
could not see his face in the dark, but his tone indicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>that the day's hard work had not abated his
tremendous energy one whit.</p>

<p>"No, Hiram, but we have everything but the
stamps and seals&mdash;we can convict him with what
we now know&mdash;I mean with the addition of what
we saw to-night&mdash;but that would not make a clean
job. We have got to get the rest of the men with
whom he must have been working, and who are
most likely in the railroad service," I replied, rapidly
analyzing.</p>

<p>"Where can we go?&mdash;what can we do to get
them?&mdash;the nearer I get to the end of this thing, I
feel almost as though I would go insane," he whispered,
at the same time grabbing me by the shoulder
as would a petulant child, and shook me until I
thought his last statement was conservative.</p>

<p>"The old fox is very sly&mdash;doesn't trust any of
his help&mdash;the stamps are not so important&mdash;the seals
he keeps in or about his office in New Orleans&mdash;our
next move is there. Hiram, can you stand a run
to New Orleans to-night?" I replied, as though
thinking aloud.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet like a cat and leaned over
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>"I can stand to do anything, without eating or
sleeping, if it takes a whole week," he replied with
set jaws.</p>

<p>The next morning we tied up at the wharf in
New Orleans. During the night I had worked out
a plan. There are times when cunning and strategical
violations of the law must be matched in order
to secure and convict criminals and the courts have
uniformly justified it. I was going to take a big
chance and finish the job quickly.</p>

<p>I left Hiram on the boat and went to our rooms
for the mail, and to get other bearings. When I
returned he was walking up and down the wharf
like a caged hyena, almost frothing at the mouth.</p>

<p>"We are up against it again&mdash;it does beat
the devil&mdash;why can't they leave us alone for a little
while, anyhow?" he demanded, his eyes shooting fire
as he stopped stolidly in front of me.</p>

<p>"What is it now, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"It's these damned shipping people&mdash;they say we
can make two round trips a week to gulf ports for
lumber, and if we don't do it willingly they will
make us&mdash;just take the boat, that's all," he exploded
in righteous wrath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span></p>

<p>"That pays, doesn't it?" I asked with a smile,
more to arouse his sense of humor.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course it pays, but haven't we got something
more important&mdash;at that, it won't pay half as
much as sawing logs from the river&mdash;and we can
let the Government have the lumber," he replied&mdash;somewhat
mollified.</p>

<p>"Hiram, you will have to go&mdash;but let's get some
breakfast while we talk it over there."</p>

<p>We went below to where a darky was frying two
big slabs of ham and a dozen eggs, also watching
a large coffee pot steaming on a three-dollar gasoline
stove. He prepared to serve the breakfast
on a table made of the head of a tobacco tierce,
with three square sticks for legs, placed in an open
space back of the engine. The chairs were a four-inch
cut-off from the end of a log, accoutered with
legs as was the table, but all cleaned and trimmed,
with good rustic effect. The entire hold of the boat
had been washed, cleaned, and put in perfect order,
and the men at that moment were scrubbing the
upper deck. He must have everything clean and
orderly.</p>

<p>Hiram sat down opposite me at this rustic round
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>table, and placed two bare arms upon it. A deep
pink rim about his eyelids was the only evidence
of fatigue after twenty-four hours of continuous
work without sleep, and while he had combed his
hair with his fingers, and still needed a shave, a
novice could see in him a big man, with tremendous
energy that chafed at delays.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;?" He looked eagerly the question as
if to save words.</p>

<p>"Hiram, have you stopped to take stock lately?
Don't you think we have made pretty good progress
in the last ten days?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we have, Ben&mdash;don't think I am finding
fault&mdash;what bothers me is&mdash;could we have done
more?&mdash;have we worked up to the limit?&mdash;and it
does worry me to think we have not done away
with this man Becker, and squared away to take
advantage of the tremendous opportunities, and&mdash;and
you know the other thing&mdash;perhaps you cannot
understand how fearfully anxious I am to go
back to Anna Bell, clean&mdash;and successful."</p>

<p>"I do believe I understand. We&mdash;well, I'd rather
say you&mdash;you have done it pretty much yourself&mdash;you
have been successful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span></p>

<p>"Heavens, yes&mdash;a month ago I was working for
a hundred and twenty-five per, and no immediate
prospects&mdash;and I would have been there yet, unless
railroaded to prison as a goat for this crowd that
you have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No more of that, Hiram," I interrupted, raising
my hand in protest&mdash;"let us talk of our immediate
movements&mdash;the way matters stand now. You
are so near out of the woods you can easily see the
clearing, but there is more work getting through
the underbrush&mdash;where there may be some snakes
or other reptiles&mdash;but that ought not to worry you.
Everything comes to those who hustle while they
wait."</p>

<p>"But you have done the most&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind now who has done the most&mdash;we
can talk of that later. The way the case now
stands, we have been to the butcher, the baker and
the grocer for the goods to provide a sumptuous
meal for Becker and his crowd, and perhaps we
have the cook, but to make 'em eat will require just
a little more time and strategy. As far as your
being clear of implication, every one knows it now&mdash;it
remains only to make it a matter of record.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span></p>

<p>"My plan for the next move may take a week
or more, but doesn't require your presence, and as
long as you are compelled to go anyhow, make a
virtue of the necessity. Get away for Gulfport as
soon as possible and&mdash;temper your anxiety and impatience
by making money. Fifteen hundred a trip&mdash;two
trips a week&mdash;is not so bad, is it?" I asked,
smiling, as I saw a shade of old-time exuberance
creeping about his mouth. He had followed my
review with rising spirits. It may be that the great
piece of ham and the half dozen eggs and steaming
coffee set before him helped a little.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> sat and eyed each other for several quiet
moments. Finally Hiram spoke. Said he, "Do
you think I can help you here? If I can, we'll
let them take the <em>Fearsome</em>&mdash;they'll have to pay
well&mdash;then we can get another one. I won't rest
well until this matter is cleaned up, lock, stock and
barrel&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, my boy, that would be an unnecessary sacrifice&mdash;boats
with any such carrying capacity and
speed are scarce; in fact, are now unobtainable.
While I am not going into details now&mdash;truth is,
I haven't yet worked out the details&mdash;I think seeing
you twice a week will be enough." It really seemed
to me that he would be only in the way, but I
thought it unwise to mention that to him.</p>

<p>While I was looking up an engineer to take my
place on the boat, Hiram went to the shippers and
drove a hard bargain, arranging for loading and
unloading at night so that he could make his run
by daylight, requiring only one shift of the crew.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>Thus he surprised me again with his keen sense of
things commercial. One would have thought he
had spent years about the docks and shipping. In
fact, Hiram Strong, Jr., had been a continuous surprise.</p>

<p>When I returned with an engineer to explain and
show him about, general merchandise was pouring
into the <em>Fearsome</em>, with black stevedores swarming
about like ants.</p>

<p>"You see, I am going to take just enough of this
merchandise to pay expenses of the trip, then our
lumber freight will be all velvet&mdash;the freight will
come out at one end while the lumber goes in at
the other and we won't lose any time, see?"</p>

<p>Yes, I did see, but didn't say much, for I was busy
planning. I remained until I saw him off and waved
to him as the <em>Fearsome</em> headed down stream. I
afterward learned that when they reached the locks
into Lake Borgne, they found the <em>Fearsome</em> could
squeeze through and save over two hundred miles
on the round trip and be running in inland water
all the way. Surely nothing got away from that
boy.</p>

<p>I returned to my old room in the general railroad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>office and took possession again. I sent at once for
Superintendent Kitchell, whom I knew was exceedingly
anxious to hear of my progress. Nothing had
been removed from my office except Miss Bascom's
desk and typewriter.</p>

<p>The superintendent came in puffing, and was
slightly indignant that I had not come to him, until
I explained that I did not want to take the slightest
chance of our conversation being overheard.</p>

<p>"We have been successful in getting pretty well
all over Becker &amp; Co.'s plant and have secured
enough evidence against them to convict, but to
finish the job and get the railroad men implicated
I need some help from you," I said, as he looked at
me with undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor, anything but the road-bed is yours,
to help you clean up this infernal mess. Only this
morning the general superintendent wired me asking
if I had anything new to report. I suppose he
was only 'passing the buck' that started away up&mdash;with
the Government maybe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tell them not to be in too big a hurry&mdash;it may
clear up soon, and it may take time yet. Mr.
Kitchell, can you invent a plausible excuse for sending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>your man Burrell out of town, some distance,
for a few days?" I asked, casually.</p>

<p>Had the points of a dozen pins been suddenly introduced
into the bottom of his chair, the effect on
him could not have been more electrical. He sprang
to his feet, indignant and angry to the point of
apoplexy.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say&mdash;you mean our chief
clerk&mdash;you should be very cautious how you attempt
to besmirch&mdash;do you actually mean him?" he
fairly shouted, moving toward me menacingly.</p>

<p>"He is either used as a tool or is directly implicated,
and with him out of town I propose to find
out which. If implicated, I want to know just how
far, but he must be sent on a half-hour notice&mdash;without
even a chance to telephone."</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;!" he exploded, and began to polish
his bare cranium with a big handkerchief. "I'll
see&mdash;that must be arranged&mdash;it can't be done in a
hurry&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just as soon as you can without arousing suspicion
will do, but I can't move, however, until
that is done," I interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so astonished I can't think now&mdash;give me a
little time."</p>

<p>"All right&mdash;and another thing, I wish you would
have Miss Bascom transferred back here to me immediately."</p>

<p>"That's easy&mdash;I will have that done at once&mdash;the
girl is all right, but Burrell," he said, shaking
his head sadly&mdash;"Burrell takes my breath," he added
as he went out, leaving the impression that the bed
of a railroad superintendent was not bowered with
roses.</p>

<p>I went out to luncheon and, although in a crowd,
not a face appeared distinct. I was so absorbed
in formulating plans to force an immediate issue
that I didn't know what I was eating.</p>

<p>Upon my return I found Miss Bascom's desk in
its accustomed place by the window. She bowed
and greeted me as one whom she had not seen for
a long time. I couldn't decide whether it was
pleasure or disappointment. I was delighted to find
a note from Superintendent Kitchell, saying he had
found a way to hurry Burrell out on the twelve-thirty
on a special errand to Kansas City that could
be lengthened at will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>Glancing over at Miss Bascom, I noted her hands
in front of her as she sat looking out of the
window, waiting for me to give her some work.
I felt that her knell had rung, the supreme moment
had arrived. Knowing that, I pitied her, for I
proposed to tear away the mask and reveal to her
the duality of her life.</p>

<p>The sunlight fell on her reddish brown hair, which
appeared unusually attractive that day. I smoked
half of my cigar in an endeavor to keep my poise
and steel myself against the pity I would have for
her during a fiery ordeal. As I had promised myself,
I would force her to hold up the last few pages
of her life for me to read, and I would use her as
a lure, an instrument, with which to fasten a crime
where it belonged&mdash;even if upon herself.</p>

<p>Swinging squarely about, I attracted her attention.
She nodded, and supposing she was to take
dictation, gathered her notebook and pencils and
came to me at once. I had the decided advantage
of a full light upon her face, while mine was shaded.</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom, it is not letters I want, but a somewhat
serious talk, and while I may ask some exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>personal questions, I would like you to
feel it is not a desire to pry into your affairs."</p>

<p>She took the advantage of remaining silent, looking
fully and frankly at me, and I thought there
was the slightest smile about her delicate lips which
I had believed&mdash;but now wondered&mdash;if Burrell had
ever touched them.</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom, you know a Mr. Becker who has
a plant up the river?"</p>

<p>Her eyes only evidenced the shock of hearing his
name, but without outward sign she replied simply&mdash;"Yes."</p>

<p>"How well do you know him?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I know him very well," she replied
with attempted frankness.</p>

<p>"You had not been here with me long until you
knew I was investigating these railroad thefts, and
that he was suspected?"</p>

<p>"I was not quite sure&mdash;you let me know so very
little," she replied with an ease that was somewhat
exasperating.</p>

<p>"Yet, during that time you were with me in&mdash;well,
rather a confidential capacity&mdash;you went out
with him to public places, drinking places, and could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>not be in ignorance of his real purpose; in fact, his
proposals were outright?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," she faltered, raising her eyes, now lighted
with a fire I thought impossible. I could not
determine whether from resentment toward me or
the recalling of certain indignities she had experienced.</p>

<p>"What is your attitude toward him now?"</p>

<p>"The same as it has always been," she replied,
her bosom heaving as a result of her mental agitation.</p>

<p>I knew I was master now, so leisurely lit another
cigar and blew a cloud of smoke between us, contemplatively.</p>

<p>"What is his attitude toward you?"</p>

<p>"I think the same as it has been." Then, looking
down at her pretty hands in her lap, she half murmured,
"Such a man does not change much."</p>

<p>This admission sounded to me like a cannon shot
and I immediately asked:</p>

<p>"You say that your relations with him are the
same as always, but you do not say what they
were."</p>

<p>This time she looked down at the toe of a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>small, neat shoe which she raised slightly to contemplate.
She remained silent for some moments,
the veins in her forehead swelling until they showed
blue through her delicate skin.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;would like to see him punished&mdash;it seems
to me that is what you want to know," she said in
a low voice in which I thought there was resentment,
but whether directed against me, Becker or
some one else I could not determine. "I would do
<em>anything</em> to have him punished," she added with
suppressed emphasis.</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom, what are your relations with Chief
Clerk Burrell?" I asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Taken completely unawares from this quarter,
she drew a very short but deep breath, recovering
quickly.</p>

<p>"They&mdash;well&mdash;I know Mr. Burrell," she admitted
slowly.</p>

<p>"You have carried on quite a flirtation with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;of course, you do not know&mdash;it would be
hard to make you understand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Does Mr. Becker know of your attitude&mdash;rather,
I mean, your relations with Mr. Burrell?" I interrupted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, he knows that I am well acquainted
with Mr. Burrell, but I don't think he quite understands
all," she admitted with some show of humility,
inclining me to the conclusion that she loved
Burrell and would save him. But I didn't care whom
she wanted to save.</p>

<p>I was perhaps somewhat brutal in saying, "I have
your word you would do <em>anything</em> to reach Mr.
Becker&mdash;of course, with the understanding that
you will be protected?"</p>

<p>She opened her mouth, showing pure white teeth,
then drew her lips tightly until no red was visible,
all the while looking squarely at me as she repeated
slowly, knowingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>anything</em>. I would go through Hell Fire!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Spirited</span>, maidenly purity will work itself into
a sort of ecstatic, swaggering turbulence, similar to
a hardened degenerate, frequently to the chagrin,
disappointment and dismay of the most practiced.</p>

<p>When through with Miss Bascom, I will confess
I could not tell in which class she belonged. War
had brought to our shores hideous flotsam, whom
I did not care, did not want, to know. I wanted
trap bait, and why not her? Had I mentioned my
belief that she had sent the anonymous notes to
Hiram, or that she had been seen dining with the
Gold-Beater, Hiram Strong, Sr., after six hours'
business acquaintance, her attitude would have instantly
developed.</p>

<p>A certain cold-blooded brutality in what I proposed
must be admitted. I wanted to clear Hiram
and finish a long-drawn-out case, and one doesn't
want to know the pedigree of the lamb used as bait
for a lion. But I proposed to save her from the fate
of the lamb in such cases, although she had consented,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>without duress, to act. I felt that it was
Burrell she wanted to save.</p>

<p>I gave her some work that would occupy about
all the afternoon, and took measures to prevent her
leaving the building or telephoning without being
overheard.</p>

<p>Becker was in the city and about his office. His
business was flourishing.</p>

<p>With the coöperation of the hotel management
two communicating rooms on the second floor were
arranged for at the hotel frequented by Becker, and
these were prepared for my purpose.</p>

<p>At four o'clock when I asked her to dress for the
street and come with me, she did so without hesitation&mdash;in
fact, she seemed eager&mdash;but I could not
be sure of that.</p>

<p>As we walked silently down to the hotel she
appeared to be sure of herself, and if she was surprised
when we entered the ladies' entrance and
walked up the one flight to the rooms, she gave no
evidence of it. I felt assured she had the necessary
self-control.</p>

<p>She was quick to notice that the door between
the two rooms was open, but made no comment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>and apparently as though in her own lodgings, removed
her hat, to make herself comfortable. She
went to the glass, touched her wonderful hair here
and there as though to add something to its alluring
arrangement, impressing me anew that she was in
point of beauty, at least, a most attractive girl, and
I again complimented Becker's ambitious taste and
selection. As for throwing herself away for the
married, sporting Burrell, I pitied her for her lack
of discrimination.</p>

<p>She took the chair I pointed to in front of a
writing desk on which was the room telephone. The
way she rested her elbow on it and half turned toward
me suggested that she awaited my signal of
"what next?"</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom," said I, taking a chair facing her,
"I feel like warning you that you are undertaking
a most delicate, difficult, and even dangerous enterprise.
If you fail through inability, it will be understood,
but if you fail by reason of half-heartedness
or any sort of treachery, I will not be responsible.
I am positively in no mood to condone such an offense,
besides I am not the only one involved in this
arrangement&mdash;there are others who are less likely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>to be trifled with than myself." I spoke good-naturedly
and with something of a plea for her own
welfare.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor," she began, in quiet, sweet, Southern
accent, "I have consented to act a part in good
faith, and if I fail it will be because it cannot be
done." Then, with charming assurance, she glanced
into the other room and at the telephone before her,
and said, "Explain just what you want me to do."</p>

<p>She seemed almost too willing and a certain nervousness
in her tone left some doubt. But we had
arranged for duplicity, and though I felt the ice a
little thin, decided to go ahead.</p>

<p>"Miss Bascom, your motive in maintaining relations
with Mr. Becker is something of a conjecture
that I am not much interested in now. It may
interest you, however, to know that I know of your
meeting with him in a wine room of this hotel."
Then taking from my pocket a typewritten report
of the meeting, I continued, "The least sound that
was made in that room at that time is here recorded
as nearly as possible in words and sound of voice.
I know what you drank, what he drank, that you
submitted to his caresses, kisses, that he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>salacious proposals, and there may have been subsequent
meetings of which we do not know."</p>

<p>She started visibly at this and moved uneasily in
her chair, laid her chin in her palm and looked
straight at me with eyes burning like fire&mdash;I thought
slightly mixed with alarm and amusement, but she
did not utter a word, so I continued:</p>

<p>"In order that you proceed intelligently in this
matter I will tell you that Becker is a criminal and
that we have ample evidence to convict him, but in
order to make it easier, and to reach others, I
want you to get him to come up here to this room,
then actually lure from him what we want."</p>

<p>She made no sign and I went on:</p>

<p>"There are times when fire must be met with fire,
crime sometimes has to be uncovered by finesse,
strategy, trick, even downright subterfuge, and this
seems to be one of the times. His weakest point is
his penchant for pretty women."</p>

<p>Miss Bascom evidenced intense interest in what
I said and seemed to weigh every word I uttered.
But she did not appear to want to reply or suggest
anything, though she seemed to take on an exultant
attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>"We have ample evidence to convict him of robbing
cars of meat products, and to do this he must
have in his possession the seals of the United States
Bureau of Animal Industry, and the shippers of the
goods in Kansas City, as well as the railroad seals,
and the instruments for adjusting. These we want.</p>

<p>"We believe that he has them secreted here in
New Orleans. The plan is that by your protestation
of interest, affection or whatnot, you will induce
him to place them in your hands for safekeeping.
We are certain he has been furnished
these things with help from Kansas City. Do you
think you can do it?" I ended by asking suddenly.</p>

<p>"What will happen if I fail?" she surprised me
by asking.</p>

<p>"If you fail and can show a clean slate, nothing
unpleasant will happen," I replied rather coldly,
suggestive of what might happen if the reverse were
true.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;think</em>&mdash;I may be able to make some headway,
but it may take more time than you anticipate,"
she warned me quietly.</p>

<p>"I don't care how much time you take, or how
much expense, but it must be a continuous performance&mdash;nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>more than an intermission will be
allowable. This telephone will be permanently connected
with mine in the next room. If he wants you
to drink, do so, and nothing containing alcohol will
come to you, and though he is copper-lined, we will
contrive to put him at a disadvantage and you can
easily use the 'phone to ask for instructions when
you are not sure." Then contemplating her critically
for a moment, I added&mdash;"You said you were
willing to do <em>anything</em>."</p>

<p>"I know I did&mdash;and I will&mdash;and I begin to feel
safe&mdash;you will protect me, won't you?" she asked
me with a delightful appeal in her eyes that could
not be refused.</p>

<p>"Every precaution has been made for that&mdash;you
will not be disturbed; the waiter who serves you is
one of our men&mdash;but you must act, you must succeed.
Becker is probably in his office now; call him
up," I added, giving his number.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about her eagerness and distinct
intention to succeed, to do <em>anything</em>, but I could
not decide whether she was moved by fear or a
genuine desire to coöperate, get revenge, or to save
Burrell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span></p>

<p>Becker fell incontinently during the first round.</p>

<p>There was in every word a purr, a coo, an invitation&mdash;she
assumed the attitude of permitting him
to come up, to see her for just a little while at the
hotel.</p>

<p>Her low laugh of triumph was more of a chuckle
as she turned to me for approbation.</p>

<p>"Fine&mdash;so far very good," I commented as though
the result was no more than expected and prepared
to go into the other room and lock the door, where
she did not know I could overhear every whisper
that passed, though she may have suspected something
of the sort.</p>

<p>Becker's haste to get there was evidenced by the
speed with which he came, and his entrance was
Falstaffian. But the real Falstaff had no such intrigue
arranged for him. He was not a criminal.</p>

<p>The meeting between Bascom and Becker lasted
over six hours. The stenographers at the dictaphone
in my room made over a hundred pages of
evidence to be used at the trial.</p>

<p>When it was over, just before midnight, and I
led Miss Bascom out of the hotel to a cab, her sturdy
body seemed a wreck. She leaned heavily on me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>and seemed to have aged greatly. As she was about
to enter the vehicle, she looked back into the building,
horrified, as though reason was unseated by
wild imaginations that she was pursued by a legion
of dreaded devils. She did not utter a word until
she was seated inside, when she reached her hand,
delicate and soft, for mine, and with gentle pressure,
exclaimed as though waking from a terrible nightmare:</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor, I have lived a hundred years in the
last six hours&mdash;but&mdash;but"&mdash;she hesitated, gasping
for breath&mdash;"I have done what I&mdash;we&mdash;what you
wanted me to do."</p>

<p>Of course, when Becker first came the overture
was drink; it always is. Having full control of
that through the waiter we saw that the first ones
had more punch than he expected, but we gave her
a mere counterfeit of what he thought she was
drinking. The sumptuous food he ordered was
carefully served. Later we had to weaken his potions
so that his mad desire would run at its height,
waiting on neither discretion nor reason. I heard
every word, every sound. Her acting was perfection.
The indignities she suffered were terrible and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>could not have been endured except for the reason
that they were fortified by a deep, enduring, sacrificial
tendency to be loyal. This conclusion forced
itself upon me. His protestations were repeated
over and over and merged into a plea for sympathy.</p>

<p>Her generalship was superb. He promised her
everything. She patiently, cautiously led him to
the point where she told him, that by reason of her
position in the office she knew he had been <em>led</em> into
certain transactions that might lead to her disgrace,
in view of the alliance he proposed.</p>

<p>"But that is all stopped," he reiterated a dozen
times.</p>

<p>Then, with wonderful acumen, she let him understand
that she knew of the existence of various
stamps and seals, finally that their very existence was
a menace and she could not feel any security in his
promise until she knew they were destroyed.</p>

<p>"I will put them at the bottom of the river to-morrow
morning."</p>

<p>"But if you are really in earnest and mean well,
you will do that now, this very night&mdash;let me see
you do it, or bring them to me," she coaxed,
wheedled, insinuated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>And then finally with the blood fired by alcohol
and that quality that makes men putty in the hands
of beauty and sex lure, he ordered a cab and in an
incredibly short time returned with quite a large
package wrapped carefully in burlap. He left the
room for a moment in his preparations for the anticipated
night. I opened the door between the
rooms, admitted her with the package, about all
she could carry, and he never saw her again. The
mad, inflamed bull was stalled with a ring in his
nose.</p>

<p>This blazed the trail to Kansas City, where I
started on the next train, and did not return for
more than a week.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as I saw Hiram I knew he was a different
man. It was not necessary for me to tell him.
Details were published in every daily paper. He
had gone back to Anna Bell Morgan clean, unsullied,
unbesmirched&mdash;his conception of what a
man should be, and prosperous beyond dreams. A
solid, forceful man, ambitious without limit, he
was much interested in the brief information I gave
him of how I had successfully uncovered and apprehended
in Kansas City all the others involved
in the crime, who evidenced a power of organization
which, if directed in legitimate channels, would
have made them rich.</p>

<p>He had rented and furnished offices, where I
found him at work.</p>

<p>"Had to have headquarters, Ben&mdash;just one room,
with an adjoining one for you&mdash;let me introduce
you to it," he said, putting his hand affectionately
on my shoulder, leading through a connecting door
into a big, well-lighted, expensively furnished office.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>"Sit down and see how it seems to have a home
of your own," he went on, pushing me into a big
leather chair and throwing up the top of a commodious
mahogany desk. Everywhere showed evidence
of the feminine touch.</p>

<p>"You see, Ben, I could not have done so well.
This is Anna Bell's idea and selection&mdash;I have told
her so much of you she feels, in fact acts, as though
she knew you as well as I do, but you will meet her
soon and she will tell you about that herself. I
never would have thought of the carpet, but she
said carpet, and there was carpet," he mused reminiscently,
as he pulled up a chair and sat down near
me where he could look out of the window.</p>

<p>"I've got to leave to-night again on the <em>Fearsome</em>
and there is so much to tell you&mdash;something I want
to ask you about."</p>

<p>I was too astonished and delighted with the enterprise
and zeal of the fellow to know what to
say.</p>

<p>"Ben, why don't you say something&mdash;don't you
like this?" he asked solicitously, leaning toward me
and scanning my face. He was the boy again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>"Hiram, give me a little time&mdash;I was wondering
how you managed so quickly to do all this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that's better," said he, a relieved smile
creeping about the upturned corners of his mouth.
"I told you I didn't&mdash;I couldn't&mdash;have done it alone&mdash;you see,
Ben, I am making three trips a week to
Gulf port instead of two, and carrying enough general
merchandise back to pay expenses," and then
turning his chair so as to look squarely at me, he
continued. "It is pouring prosperity, though
we are making a willing, patriotic sacrifice while
doing it, and we must hustle like sixty until the
rain is over."</p>

<p>I looked at him more astonished, as I felt sure
something bigger was coming. Was there no
limit?</p>

<p>"We are making money pretty fast now, but this
won't last&mdash;I know now the logs in the river will
disappear soon after we get at them again, and you
know we have got to look ahead. I can buy a tract
of timber up there at Gulfport&mdash;cheap&mdash;enough
timber to keep us sawing for years. Now don't look
so alarmed&mdash;it will take a lot of money, but we've
got to do it if it is possible. I've opened a bank account
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>here and talked to the president about it&mdash;but
everything now is going into Liberty bonds and
you can't blame them&mdash;but it's got to be done, Ben,"
he repeated in a tense undertone, bringing his hard
hand down on my knee with a loud slap.</p>

<p>Looking at him in wonder for a moment, I finally
asked,</p>

<p>"How much will it take, Hiram?"</p>

<p>"Now don't fall over when I tell you&mdash;that's why
I got a big chair with a soft cushion, so that you
could sustain a shock once in a while without injury.
Ben, it will take about a hundred thousand
dollars to get it, but it's got to come," he ended,
passing his hand rapidly over his chin as though glad
it was out.</p>

<p>"You have not forgotten, Hiram, that you must
settle with the railroad for the engine in the <em>Fearsome</em>
and the sawmill, too?"</p>

<p>"I know we have, but I've got enough in the bank
for that and more besides," he replied quickly.
"What do you think, is it possible?" he asked, making
me feel he was not to be resisted.</p>

<p>"I don't know, Hiram; you are placing a pretty
big order&mdash;we'll see&mdash;I don't believe I told you just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>how much I sold that barrel for, did I?" turning
to him with an affected smile of derision.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know you will have the laugh on me as
long as you live about that barrel; in fact, I will
laugh myself every time I think of it even if I am
at a funeral, but that couldn't happen again in a
million years," he replied, getting up and pacing the
room, finally halting in the opposite corner, where
he catapulted a question as though he might be
coming along with it.</p>

<p>"How much did you get for it, Ben?"</p>

<p>"It was as you say, Hiram, a thousand-to-one
shot that could not have happened and never will
happen again&mdash;I don't claim any credit, except in
discovering it was not junk, by a little leakage
through the chimes which discolored my fingers."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know&mdash;you never claim anything," he
interrupted.</p>

<p>"You see, we had to pay something like twenty
thousand to clear the <em>Fearsome</em>."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that."</p>

<p>"Well, I think there is a balance in the bank of
something about forty thousand more&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are joking again, Ben," he interrupted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>charging over toward me, incredulous, as I took
from my wallet a credit slip which he grasped and
began to cavort and cut capers on the expensive
carpet, much the same as he acted at the first signs
of good luck, months before.</p>

<p>"Ben, you are a mascot&mdash;you have been one to
me, anyhow&mdash;now in another month&mdash;before this
deal can be closed&mdash;I can pay the railroad claim for
the motor and the sawmill, and every other stiver
we owe. And we'll have at least ten thousand more
to bring our balance up to fifty thousand. Now,
how can we raise fifty thousand more?" he asked,
fairly excited&mdash;he pronounced <em>fifty thousand</em> as
though he was used to dealing in those figures all
his life&mdash;as though it was no more than the price
of one of those famous beefsteaks he liked so well.
He must have inherited it from the Gold-Beater&mdash;as
he did the love for new, clean lumber and the
lumber business. Hiram admitted he knew so little
of his father that he was unaware I knew he was
a Lumber King.</p>

<p>I took out cigars, thinking hard, and offered him
one.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I prefer a pipe," said he producing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>one at once as something he had overlooked.</p>

<p>"Hiram, give me a little time&mdash;you say you leave
this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I ought to be on the dock now," said he,
blowing a cloud of smoke and scanning me as
though to learn just what I was thinking. "I
will be back day after to-morrow," he added, anticipating
the question.</p>

<p>"I'll see"&mdash;I said, moving back a little in my big
chair and contemplating the end of my cigar&mdash;"perhaps
when you get back I may have something&mdash;maybe
there is a way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say maybe&mdash;say you will do it," he
prodded.</p>

<p>"Hiram, I still say <em>maybe</em>," I answered firmly,
wondering whether the Gold-Beater was still down
the river shooting ducks, and if I could get into
touch with him before <span class="err" title="original: Him">Hiram</span> returned.</p>

<p>Early on the morning he was due back, a messenger
came to say I was wanted on the telephone
by some one at Lake Borgne Locks. I knew it was
Hiram&mdash;he had probably been calling Anna Bell
Morgan to tell her of his arrival and knew he would
catch me in my room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>"What news?" he asked as though tired of waiting,
and more, as though he expected it to be favorable.</p>

<p>"The news is all right."</p>

<p>"Oh, I knew it would be," he broke in, not waiting
for me to finish. "Say, I will be up to the docks
at eight, and be at the office at ten&mdash;meet me there,"
and he hung up abruptly.</p>

<p>This suited me exactly. I was through and had
made reservation on a train leaving for the North&mdash;for
home and a little rest.</p>

<p>I had cleaned up everything except a little writing
and was doing that in the office that had been so
generously provided for me, when I heard Hiram
enter his adjoining room. The door between was
not tightly closed, and I was aware at once he was
not alone. He had evidently made an engagement
also with Anna Bell Morgan. I could hear his voice
easily, and as I was aroused from the preoccupation
of my writing, I could hear her voice, and as I
listened closely there came a shock, a slow, leaden,
enervating, numbing shock on recognizing the voice
of Miss Bascom, my clerk. The whole thing swam
slowly before me. I knew now why she had acted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>her rôle with such intensity and risk. I felt an impulse
to grab my grip and bolt through the door
into the hall and take my train without meeting them
together, but I didn't have time before he came
bursting through the door leading her proudly to
me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Taylor, I introduce my wife. I forgot to
tell you we were to be married at nine." I arose,
took her extended hand as she looked at me squarely,
radiantly, but with a plea. I got her message, but
I think I made a failure of the greeting and congratulations.
I was afraid Hiram noticed it. In
fact, I felt sheepish that I had not discovered that
she had assumed a name and underwent the disgusting
experiences with Becker and Burrell to help
him.</p>

<p>"Not going away, Ben?" Hiram asked, noticing
my grip&mdash;he never overlooked anything.</p>

<p>"Yes, Hiram, I am going to leave you now&mdash;I am
through here."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you don't mean&mdash;when will you be back,
Ben?" he asked, glancing in alarm first at me and
then at his bride of an hour.</p>

<p>"I don't know when I will return, Hiram. Just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>now I have to answer the call of others. I may
come back to testify at the trial."</p>

<p>"You don't mean you are not going to stay here
with me&mdash;when things are just getting started
right?" he began, coming over and placing one hand
on the back of my chair and bending forward to
look in my face to see if I was ill.</p>

<p>"Sit down&mdash;both of you," I interrupted, looking
at Anna Bell's radiance changing to disappointment
too, as he brought chairs up near me. "I have a
confession to make, and I like to do the unpleasant
things first and have them over with."</p>

<p>"But say, old fellow, you can't leave me now&mdash;I
need you in so many ways&mdash;you see, we have been
through so much together&mdash;&mdash;" began Hiram, leaning
well forward in his chair.</p>

<p>"It cannot be&mdash;just now anyhow&mdash;and perhaps
you will not want me to do so when I admit to a
certain sort of duplicity&mdash;but at which I hope in the
course of time you will look upon tolerantly, forgivingly&mdash;I
don't want you to think badly of me&mdash;as
I have in the last few months become deeply attached
to you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you getting at, Ben&mdash;I will never believe
you have deceived&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait till I tell you why I came here&mdash;left New
York with you, was paid a definite sum and expenses
for <span class="err" title="original: dong">doing</span> so for a definite purpose, and that purpose
is now accomplished, and the Government, engaged
in a gigantic war, calls me to other activities. I
must&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care what you have done or been, though
I don't quite understand," he began, his voice almost
failing; "we are doing work for the Government
just as important as any&mdash;and I need you."</p>

<p>"You may have needed me, Hiram, but you don't
now&mdash;you are nicely started and you have better
help now than I can give," I broke in, looking at
Anna Bell, who was as much affected as Hiram.
"She is courageous, a natural diplomat and wonderful
at plans, and besides, you can now stand alone
and must learn to rely on yourself, and besides, more
than two in a firm often complicates matters."</p>

<p>"I know&mdash;I know&mdash;I can see&mdash;but you don't explain&mdash;what
is this you are hinting&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Hiram, it may be better for it to come to you
gradually. Now let us talk about money for my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>train goes soon and I find I need some money, and I
must give you the big check necessary to pay for
the timber land. First of all, will you cash these
checks for me? These are my salary checks I have
never used," I explained as I took them out, turned
to the desk and endorsed them, aware that Hiram
and Anna Bell were looking at each other and trying
to understand.</p>

<p>"Ben, I am sure this is only a misconception&mdash;a
feeling of delicacy&mdash;that you may be interfering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, Hiram, my plans are definite; I cannot
change them if I would," said I, handing him the
checks as soberly as though not anticipating his
astonishment when he saw them.</p>

<p>At first he did not look at them, but laid them
on his knee as a mere matter of detail. He was too
busy trying to divine what was going on in my
mind; finally glancing down at them, he became
aware there was something familiar about them, and
then his excitement knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"How the devil"&mdash;he began, raising half out
of his chair, tapping the checks wildly&mdash;"how did
you get these? Why, these are like the ones I used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>to&mdash;now I understand," he said, subsiding, quite
overcome. "Ben, were you paid by my father? My
God, is it possible&mdash;then he didn't kick me out&mdash;it
was just his way&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just his way to teach you to work and make
amends for his neglect, and here is another one,
the big one for fifty thousand signed by him, too&mdash;you
may be surprised to know he is now down in
the lower reaches of the river, duck-shooting. When
I saw him yesterday, I had no difficulty; everything
seemed to be prepared for the proposition," I said;
looking quizzically at Anna Bell. Mixed with her
delight was a shade of fear and apprehension. I
tried to make her understand that she must tell him
herself about her captivating the Gold-Beater, securing
his approval and further support, of the
Becker episode, her assumed name&mdash;and all to help
Hiram. In fact, I did not have the courage to do
it.</p>

<p>"I can hardly conceive my father&mdash;&mdash;" Here his
voice broke completely.</p>

<p>"And you can hardly credit that the <em>Fearsome</em>
might have been placed conveniently in the canal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, heavens, and I thought we were doing it&mdash;and
did he plan all that trouble in the river&mdash;did
his men, the lawyers, take her from&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I guess he did, Hiram; he wanted to try
you out&mdash;a last real trial&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And the barrel, Ben, did he have anything&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"No, Hiram, that was a piece of just dumb luck
that will always be with you&mdash;send me a check for
half of it when you get things straightened out," I
said, grabbing my grip and bolting. As I rounded
the corner of the hall for the elevator, I glanced
back. They stood out in the hall, their arms around
each other, watching me go.</p>
